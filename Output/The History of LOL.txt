[Stone-Bronze Era]
LOL began as a small community surviving through simple tools, shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice shaped whether LOL could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.

The winds of change brought forth an unexpected turn:  A sudden abundance of valuable resources brought prosperity, but risked pride and tension between the people of LOL.


To mitigate the immediate risks, LOL sent settlers to explore and expand into new and promising regions.

The outcome proved decisive: The distant lands prove treacherous, and many settlers never return. The losses shake the tribe’s confidence and cast a shadow over the boom.



As one chapter closed, another immediately opened...


A new chapter began when Disagreements between clans over traditions, rituals, and ancestral customs threatened to fracture the unity of LOL.


To mitigate the immediate risks, LOL asked the shamans to conduct a spirit‑walk, seeking guidance from the all-fathers of LOL.

The outcome proved decisive: The shamans return with visions of clan totems walking side by side. Their message of harmony reassures the people, restoring faith that the ancestors favour unity over discord.


[Classical Era]
LOL strengthens into an organised society with structured laws, wider trade, and growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances expand its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshape its borders. Prosperity rises, but so do rivalries and debates over authority. How LOL balances ambition and stability determines its path through this transformative age.

Destiny's hand stirred when INTERNAL CONFLICT — Growing cities strain under class tensions, rival guilds, and political clubs. Competing interests threaten to fracture civic unity.


Facing uncertainty, the people of LOL Support a philosopher-led civic campaign promoting shared identity.

In the wake of their action, Philosophers divide into factions themselves, each claiming the true interpretation of civic virtue. Their debates spill into the streets, worsening unrest.



Yet another challenge awaited them...


The winds of change brought forth an unexpected turn: CULTURAL SCHISM — Philosophers, generals, priests, and merchants clash over values and the direction of the state. Ideological divides threaten the harmony of the republic or kingdom.


To address the challenge, LOL's leadership Commission respected philosophers to write doctrines promoting unity.

What followed changed everything: Rival schools of thought dispute the doctrines, each claiming the others distort truth. Citizens divide along intellectual lines, deepening the schism.


[Medieval Era]
LOL enters an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and powerful traditions. Faith shapes governance, merchants connect distant routes, and scholars preserve knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threaten stability. Survival depends on how LOL navigates obligations, alliances, and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.

The course of history shifted as CULTURAL SCHISM — Rival faiths, regional customs, and noble traditions clash, threatening the kingdom’s unity. Priests, nobles, and common folk disagree over values that shape daily life.


In response to the worsening situation, the council Send knights and heralds to travel the realm teaching the crown’s ideals.

History would record that Harsh enforcement by overzealous knights leads to resentment. Some communities refuse to host them, worsening tensions.



Yet another challenge awaited them...


A new chapter began when RESOURCE SHORTAGE — A failed harvest, disrupted caravan, or mismanaged storehouse has led to widespread scarcity. Grain prices rise, villages stir with unease, and whispers of misrule test the kingdom's stability.


To ensure long-term stability, the leaders of LOL Send knights and stewards to inspect granaries for mismanagement or hoarding.

In the wake of their action, Knights overstep their authority, seizing goods from innocent farmers. Panic spreads as rumours of tyranny circulate, and several villages refuse to cooperate with royal officers.


[Modern Era]
Industrial change reshapes LOL with new technologies, expanding factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenge old systems, while global trade raises both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerates faster than society adapts, and LOL must balance progress with stability as it confronts competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.

In the midst of their journey, the people of LOL faced: RESOURCE SHORTAGE — A supply crisis hits the nation as fuel, materials, or essential goods run scarce due to embargoes, industrial failures, or global disruption. Factories stall, transport slows, and citizens grow anxious.


To ensure long-term stability, the leaders of LOL Fund emergency research to engineer synthetic alternatives to the scarce resource.

As the dust settled, the result was undeniable: The research burns through money with little progress. Headlines mock the 'million-dollar miracle that never came,' and funding scandals erode trust in scientific institutions.



The people of LOL had little time to rest before...


A pivotal moment arrived when ECONOMIC BOOM — A surge in technological innovation, investment, or global trade brings sudden prosperity. Wealth rises rapidly, but so do the risks of inequality and instability.


To address the challenge, LOL's leadership Invest heavily in public infrastructure and modern transportation.

What followed changed everything: Projects overrun budgets and deadlines. Corruption scandals emerge, and citizens accuse leadership of mismanagement despite the booming economy.


[Space Era]
LOL extends its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities, lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel open new frontiers, but resources stretch thin and political interests diverge across worlds. Each decision carries amplified consequences, shaping whether LOL thrives among the stars or fractures under interplanetary pressures.

Without warning, CULTURAL SCHISM — As humanity spreads across planets, cultures diverge. Colonists, Earth-born citizens, AI-driven societies, and genetically modified populations clash over identity, autonomy, and the future of civilisation.


To ensure long-term stability, the leaders of LOL Recognise and protect unique planetary cultures through interstellar legislation.

What followed changed everything: Granting formal protection earns widespread respect. Colonies feel acknowledged, leading to renewed diplomatic cooperation.



Yet another challenge awaited them...


Destiny's hand stirred when ECONOMIC BOOM — Hyper-efficient automation, asteroid mining breakthroughs, or quantum markets trigger explosive economic growth. Wealth surges, but inequality across planets risks destabilising civilisation.


To prevent future complications, the city elders Support small-scale lunar, Martian, and orbital entrepreneurs with microgrants.

History would record that Innovation blossoms across colonies as independent inventors create new markets. The boom feels inclusive and empowering.
