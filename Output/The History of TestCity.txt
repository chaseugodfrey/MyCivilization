[Stone-Bronze Era]
TestCity began as a small community surviving through simple tools, shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice shaped whether TestCity could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.

Destiny's hand stirred when A season of scarcity descended upon TestCity, testing unity as food and clean water sources dwindled.


consolidated resources by merging all of TestCity's stores together temporarily. 

Fate's judgment came swiftly: Clans place their stores together inside a great longhouse, guarded by representatives from each family. The shared responsibility rekindles unity, ensuring that even meagre portions stretch farther than before.



Scarcely had they recovered when...


A pivotal moment arrived when Disagreements between clans over traditions, rituals, and ancestral customs threatened to fracture the unity of TestCity.


conducted a symbolic hunt requiring warriors from all clans to cooperate, in an effort to re-unite the clans.

In the wake of their action, The hunt ends in chaos as miscommunication causes injury and lost prey. The failure becomes a symbol of the tribe’s fractured spirit.


[Classical Era]
TestCity strengthens into an organised society with structured laws, wider trade, and growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances expand its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshape its borders. Prosperity rises, but so do rivalries and debates over authority. How TestCity balances ambition and stability determines its path through this transformative age.

The winds of change brought forth an unexpected turn: CULTURAL SCHISM — Philosophers, generals, priests, and merchants clash over values and the direction of the state. Ideological divides threaten the harmony of the republic or kingdom.


Host a public forum where citizens debate openly under magistrate supervision.

The decision bore fruit when The forum becomes a celebration of reasoned discourse. Citizens feel heard, tempers ease, and the shared pursuit of knowledge rekindles unity across factions.



The people of TestCity had little time to rest before...


The horizon darkened as RESOURCE SHORTAGE - Despite the splendour of the Classical age, scarcity threatens civilisation as drought, failing mines, or disrupted trade routes strain supplies and test public confidence.


Redirect state labour to restore farmlands and irrigation canals.

The outcome proved decisive: Farmers and engineers restore ancient canals and expand irrigation networks. Crops begin to recover as water returns to the fields, reassuring citizens that the state remains capable of protecting their livelihood. Public confidence rises in the government’s competence.


[Medieval Era]
TestCity enters an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and powerful traditions. Faith shapes governance, merchants connect distant routes, and scholars preserve knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threaten stability. Survival depends on how TestCity navigates obligations, alliances, and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.

In the midst of their journey, the people of TestCity faced: ECONOMIC BOOM — Prosperity surges as trade expands and new resources flow into the kingdom. Wealth spreads, but so does the temptation toward greed and excess.


Commission new stone roads to connect distant towns.

The path chosen led to an outcome none could ignore: Construction overruns drain the treasury. Nobles argue over road routes, delaying progress and souring the public’s feelings about the project.



But the trials were far from over...


A new chapter began when RESOURCE SHORTAGE — A failed harvest, disrupted caravan, or mismanaged storehouse has led to widespread scarcity. Grain prices rise, villages stir with unease, and whispers of misrule test the kingdom's stability.


Request emergency grain shipments from neighbouring kingdoms through noble diplomacy.

Time would tell that Allied lords agree to send grain as goodwill payments, strengthening regional alliances. The gesture eases famine fears and elevates your realm’s reputation as honourable and worthy of support.


[Modern Era]
Industrial change reshapes TestCity with new technologies, expanding factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenge old systems, while global trade raises both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerates faster than society adapts, and TestCity must balance progress with stability as it confronts competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.

In the midst of their journey, the people of TestCity faced: MORAL DILEMMA — A controversial legal case, whistleblower leak, or viral injustice forces the nation to confront questions of ethics, justice, and social stability.


Hold a transparent public hearing broadcast nationwide.

What followed changed everything: The hearing becomes politicised, with grandstanding overshadowing substance. Public frustration intensifies as real answers fail to emerge.



As one chapter closed, another immediately opened...


Without warning, FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT — Diplomatic tensions spike after a border violation, cyberattack, or leaked intelligence. Nations watch closely as the situation threatens global stability.


Request emergency mediation from neutral global organisations.

The outcome proved decisive: International mediators defuse tensions effectively, producing a fair diplomatic resolution. Your leadership is credited for seeking peaceful solutions.


[Space Era]
TestCity extends its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities, lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel open new frontiers, but resources stretch thin and political interests diverge across worlds. Each decision carries amplified consequences, shaping whether TestCity thrives among the stars or fractures under interplanetary pressures.

Destiny's hand stirred when RESOURCE SHORTAGE — A critical shortage emerges: deuterium for fusion cores, helium-3 for lunar reactors, rare metals for shipyards, or water for colonies. Mining accidents, FTL disruptions, or diplomatic tension threaten stability across worlds.


Invest in a breakthrough synthetic material engineered in zero-gravity research labs.

As the dust settled, the result was undeniable: The prototypes destabilise under atmospheric pressure, destroying the research facility. Funding collapses and confidence in off-world science wavers.



Scarcely had they recovered when...


Without warning, ECONOMIC BOOM — Hyper-efficient automation, asteroid mining breakthroughs, or quantum markets trigger explosive economic growth. Wealth surges, but inequality across planets risks destabilising civilisation.


Lower interplanetary trade tariffs to stimulate economic exchange.

As the dust settled, the result was undeniable: Trade routes flourish as goods flow freely across worlds. Markets stabilise and optimism spreads throughout colonies.
