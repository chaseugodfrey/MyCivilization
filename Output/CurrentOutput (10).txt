Send a hunting–scouting band into distant wildlands.

Outcome: The scouts vanish into the deep wilds, never returning. Their absence casts a shadow across the tribe, and parents forbid their children from wandering far as fear spreads and scarcity tightens its grip.

Event: DISEASE OUTBREAK — Illness sweeps through crowded cities and trade ports. The state must act quickly to contain panic and loss.

Consult herbalists, healers, and foreign physicians for remedies.

Political movements challenge old systems, while global trade raises both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerates faster than society adapts, and John Pork must balance progress with stability as it confronts competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.


Event: CULTURAL SCHISM — As communication accelerates and cities expand, ideological and cultural groups clash over identity, values, and national direction. Polarisation threatens to fracture the nation.

Share the discovery only with colonies facing economic or social instability.

Outcome: The discovery accelerates development across every world. Innovation flourishes as colonies unlock new potential, strengthening unity through shared advancement.
