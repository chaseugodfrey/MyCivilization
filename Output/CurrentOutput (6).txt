[Stone-Bronze]

Your civilisation stands at the threshold between primitive survival and organised society, guided by both practical instincts and the whispers of ancestral spirits.


Propose a labour-sharing project requiring clans to work together.

Outcome: Leaders gather around the central fire, voicing frustrations and misunderstandings. Through patient dialogue, they rediscover shared goals and agree to renewed cooperation.


Ask the clans to vote collectively on the morally ambiguous issue.

Outcome: The outsider recovers and proves to be skilled in crafting and gathering. Grateful for your compassion, they share knowledge that benefits the entire tribe and reinforces values of empathy.


[Classical]

The Classical Era marks a turning point in your civilisation. City-states rise from once-simple settlements, roads bind regions together, and philosophy, mathematics, and organised armies become the tools of progress. Temples, forums, and academies shape the minds of leaders, while distant borders expand through diplomacy or conquest. Yet with greater power comes greater complexity—political rivalries deepen, citizens debate justice and order, and the state must balance prosperity with stability.


Allow each faction temporary autonomy to self-govern locally.

Outcome: The guilds meet under structured dialogue, finally airing grievances in a civil manner. Compromise becomes possible, and productivity rises as tensions cool.


Fund a public works project to provide employment and reduce tensions.

Outcome: The guilds meet under structured dialogue, finally airing grievances in a civil manner. Compromise becomes possible, and productivity rises as tensions cool.


[Medieval]

The Medieval Era dawns on a world of fortified cities, noble houses, and sprawling kingdoms bound together by oaths, religion, and feudal obligations. Knights defend the realm, scholars preserve ancient knowledge in scriptoria, and merchants traverse growing trade routes. Yet the age is turbulent—rival lords feud for dominance, faith shapes politics, and common folk bear the weight of war, famine, and plague. How your civilisation balances duty, honour, and ambition will determine whether it thrives or falls into darkness.


Request emergency grain shipments from neighbouring kingdoms through noble diplomacy.

Outcome: Knights overstep their authority, seizing goods from innocent farmers. Panic spreads as rumours of tyranny circulate, and several villages refuse to cooperate with royal officers.


Fund joint projects—bridges, mills, or markets—that require cooperation between rivals.

Outcome: The tribunal reveals deep grudges that neither side will abandon. Accusations of bias follow, and some lords leave more resentful than when they arrived.


[Modern]

The Modern Era emerges with industrial power, scientific breakthroughs, and rapidly expanding global connections. Factories roar to life, cities climb skyward, and new ideologies shape the world’s political landscape. Nations compete for resources and influence, while ordinary citizens navigate unprecedented freedoms and pressures. Technological optimism clashes with social upheaval, and every decision tests the balance between progress, stability, and humanity’s future course.


Mobilise engineering teams to rebuild infrastructure with modern, disaster-resistant designs.

Outcome: Logistical failures lead to delayed rescue attempts. Media broadcasts the chaos, sparking outrage and demands for accountability.


Form an emergency coalition with opposition parties to stabilise governance.

Outcome: The press conference spirals into hostile questioning. Poor responses go viral, worsening the scandal and deepening distrust.


[Space]

Humanity stands at the dawn of interstellar expansion. Orbital shipyards glitter above Earth, lunar cities hum with industry, and the first colonies on Mars and Europa struggle toward independence. Terraforming engines pulse across barren worlds, fusion reactors power megastructures, and faster-than-light corridors open pathways to distant stars. Yet with this bold frontier come new tensions—resource demands skyrocket, politics fracture across planets, and alien microbial risks challenge human biology. The galaxy offers limitless opportunity, but one misstep can send civilisation spiraling into cosmic isolation or collapse. Every decision now echoes across multiple worlds.


Evacuate vulnerable colonies using FTL-capable relief vessels.

Outcome: Evacuation corridors overload. Several ships become stranded mid-jump, causing panic and interplanetary outrage.


Deploy terraforming stabilizers to contain atmospheric or geological damage.

Outcome: The evacuation proceeds with precision. Millions are relocated safely, and gratitude strengthens interplanetary unity.
