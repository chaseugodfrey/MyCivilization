[Stone-Bronze Era]
Coriander began as a small community surviving through simple tools, shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice shaped whether Coriander could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.

Destiny's hand stirred when A wave of cultural renewal swept through the clans of Coriander, inspiring new interpretations of traditions, rituals, and ancestral customs. The city’s unity grew stronger in some ways and more uncertain in others, depending on how these evolving practices were embraced.
Acting with mindful intention, Coriander asked the shamans to conduct a spirit‑walk, seeking guidance from the all-fathers of Coriander.
As the dust settled, the result was undeniable: The shamans returned from their spirit-walk with visions of the clan totems walking side by side. Their message of harmony reassured the people, restoring faith that the ancestors favoured unity over discord.

Time revealed its next trial when A difficult season settled over Coriander as food stores thinned and clean water grew harder to find. Though not yet catastrophic, the strain tested cooperation and resourcefulness across the settlement.
Troubled by uncertainty, the people sent a scouting party into distant wildlands to search for new sources of food.
The consequences of this choice soon became clear: The scouts found little beyond barren ground and lurking predators. Many never returned, and their disappearance weighed heavily on the clans, deepening the sense of strain and uncertainty.

[Classical Era]
Coriander had strengthened into an organised society with structured laws, wider trade, and a growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances had expanded its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshaped its borders. Prosperity had risen, but so had rivalries and debates over authority. How Coriander balanced ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative age.

Time revealed its next trial when A vibrant cultural renaissance swept through Coriander, as poets, philosophers, artisans, and scholars reinterpreted ancient traditions. New ideas filled its forums and academies, strengthening civic identity, but also stirring disagreements with those who preferred old traditions.
With hopes of a better outcome, the people established an academy dedicated to preserving ancient customs while teaching innovative practices.
As the dust settled, the result was undeniable: The academy became dominated by rigid instructors who rejected ideas that did not align with their doctrine. Innovation stagnated, and resentment grew among those who felt the renaissance had been caged.

As days passed, a new development emerged: An influx of rare goods and valuable resources reached Coriander through expanded trade routes. Prosperity surged, offering opportunities for growth—yet demanding careful stewardship to ensure wealth did not breed inequality.
Seeking to strengthen Coriander, the clans invested the surplus into repairing roads and strengthening trade routes.
The outcome proved decisive: Repairs proved costlier than expected, draining the surplus before the work was complete. Several routes remained unfinished, frustrating merchants and leaving Coriander exposed to criticism for wasted resources.

[Medieval Era]
Coriander entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes, and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened stability. Survival depended on how Coriander navigated obligations, alliances, and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.

Time revealed its next trial when Rival sects, olden customs, and noble traditions collided within Coriander, as the common folk argued over whose rites should guide the kingdom. What Coriander would affect how its future was affected down the line.
Committed to safeguarding Coriander’s future, the people granted noble houses authority to enforce their preferred traditions within their own territories.
The outcome proved decisive: The nobles ruled with measured wisdom, adapting traditions to local needs without stirring unrest. Their leadership brought stability, and Coriander prospered under a patchwork of well-managed customs.

Time revealed its next trial when A mismanaged granary left Coriander short of grain as winter approached. Prices soared, villagers murmured of incompetence or corruption, and unrest simmered at the edges of the realm.
Concerned about worsening conditions, the leaders sent knights and stewards to inspect granaries for hoarding.
As the dust settled, the result was undeniable: The inspections angered several powerful households accused of wrongdoing. Tensions rose, and accusations of overreach deepened mistrust between the council and the nobility.

[Modern Era]
Industrial change reshaped Coriander with new technologies, expanding factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenged old systems, while global trade raised both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerated faster than society adapted, and Coriander had to balance progress with stability as it confronted competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.

The winds of change brought forth an unexpected turn: A breakthrough in machinery spread through Coriander, promising faster production, reduced labour strain, and new innovations. How the city adopted these innovations would reshape its future.
With hopes of a better outcome, the people restricted initial use of the innovation to skilled engineers for careful testing.
Time would tell that The secrecy surrounding the testing raised suspicion among workers and guilds. Rumours of hidden dangers spread, and resentment built even before the innovation was revealed.

Time revealed its next trial when Calls for representation rose among workers, merchants, and intellectuals in Coriander. Pressure for fair laws, safer labour conditions, and civic accountability signaled a new era of potential reform.
Encouraged by signs of possibility, Coriander invited respected legal scholars to draft a revised civic charter.
Fate's judgment came swiftly: The scholars’ proposals were criticised as overly academic and disconnected from workers’ realities. Public confidence wavered, and the draft was ultimately rejected.

[Space Era]
Coriander extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities, lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether Coriander thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.

The course of history shifted as As humanity spread across the star systems of Coriander, cultures diverged at light-year distances. Planet-born settlers, orbital megastructure dwellers, AI-guided societies, and gene-augmented lineages clashed over identity and the right to define civilisation’s future.
With hopes of a better outcome, the people commissioned a unified historical archive to preserve the origins of all cultures and strengthen a shared civilisational narrative.
Time would tell that The archive sparked outrage as some groups felt misrepresented or diminished. Disputes over historical interpretation erupted, and old grievances resurfaced with renewed intensity.

The horizon darkened as Hyper-adaptive automation and self-replicating fabrication fleets triggered an era of unprecedented abundance across Coriander. Wealth surged through the networks of human and synthetic citizens alike, yet power concentrated dangerously in the hands of a few megacorporate clusters.
With hopes of a better outcome, the people invited corporate leaders to a prosperity summit to negotiate fairer economic terms.
The path chosen led to an outcome none could ignore: After intense debate, the summit produced a cooperative economic charter. Corporate leaders accepted new ethical constraints, and a more sustainable prosperity emerged across Coriander.
