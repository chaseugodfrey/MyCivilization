[Stone-Bronze Era]

Your civilisation stands at the threshold between primitive survival and organised society, guided by both practical instincts and the whispers of ancestral spirits.


Event: DISEASE OUTBREAK - An unfamiliar sickness spreads through the tribe, weakening hunters, worrying healers, and threatening to overwhelm the settlement.

Designate a sacred healing area where only healers may tend to the sick.

Outcome: Families protest the separation, sneaking into the isolation camp and undermining containment. The sickness spreads faster than before, creating panic.


Event: CULTURAL SCHISM - Disagreements between clans over traditions, rituals, and ancestral customs threaten to fracture the unity of the tribe.

Ask the shamans to conduct a spirit‑walk seeking ancestral guidance.

Outcome: At the Great Fire Gathering, each clan shares its stories and sacred songs. Differences soften as the tribe recognises the shared roots beneath their customs. Warmth replaces tension.


[Classical Era]

The Classical Era marks a turning point in your civilisation. City-states rise from once-simple settlements, roads bind regions together, and philosophy, mathematics, and organised armies become the tools of progress. Temples, forums, and academies shape the minds of leaders, while distant borders expand through diplomacy or conquest. Yet with greater power comes greater complexity—political rivalries deepen, citizens debate justice and order, and the state must balance prosperity with stability.


Event: INTERNAL CONFLICT — Growing cities strain under class tensions, rival guilds, and political clubs. Competing interests threaten to fracture civic unity.

Deploy magistrates to mediate disputes directly in the streets.

Outcome: The guilds meet under structured dialogue, finally airing grievances in a civil manner. Compromise becomes possible, and productivity rises as tensions cool.


Event: INTERNAL CONFLICT — Growing cities strain under class tensions, rival guilds, and political clubs. Competing interests threaten to fracture civic unity.

Fund a public works project to provide employment and reduce tensions.

Outcome: Rival guilds use the council as a stage for power plays. Old disagreements ignite into fresh feuds, worsening the struggle for influence within the city.


[Medieval Era]

The Medieval Era dawns on a world of fortified cities, noble houses, and sprawling kingdoms bound together by oaths, religion, and feudal obligations. Knights defend the realm, scholars preserve ancient knowledge in scriptoria, and merchants traverse growing trade routes. Yet the age is turbulent—rival lords feud for dominance, faith shapes politics, and common folk bear the weight of war, famine, and plague. How your civilisation balances duty, honour, and ambition will determine whether it thrives or falls into darkness.


Event: FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT — A border skirmish, intercepted messenger, or insulted ambassador threatens peace with a neighbouring realm.

Invite foreign dignitaries to a feast celebrating unity between nations.

Outcome: The envoys succeed in soothing tensions. Rival rulers acknowledge the goodwill gesture, and diplomatic channels reopen with renewed trust.


Event: LEADERSHIP CRISIS — Nobles question the crown’s authority, claiming misrule or favouritism. Whispers of rebellion spread through courtly halls.

Call a grand assembly of nobles to address grievances openly.

Outcome: The assembly restores trust through open dialogue. Nobles leave satisfied, and unity returns to the realm’s leadership.


[Modern Era]

The Modern Era emerges with industrial power, scientific breakthroughs, and rapidly expanding global connections. Factories roar to life, cities climb skyward, and new ideologies shape the world’s political landscape. Nations compete for resources and influence, while ordinary citizens navigate unprecedented freedoms and pressures. Technological optimism clashes with social upheaval, and every decision tests the balance between progress, stability, and humanity’s future course.


Event: FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT — Diplomatic tensions spike after a border violation, cyberattack, or leaked intelligence. Nations watch closely as the situation threatens global stability.

Send diplomats to negotiate an immediate de-escalation agreement.

Outcome: Negotiations stall as the opposing nation refuses to cooperate. Your attempts at diplomacy are mocked globally, and tensions worsen.


Event: LEADERSHIP CRISIS — Scandals, disagreements, or sudden resignations shake the government. Confidence in leadership wavers as rivals manoeuvre for power.

Launch a public inquiry led by independent investigators.

Outcome: The press conference spirals into hostile questioning. Poor responses go viral, worsening the scandal and deepening distrust.


[Space Era]

Humanity stands at the dawn of interstellar expansion. Orbital shipyards glitter above Earth, lunar cities hum with industry, and the first colonies on Mars and Europa struggle toward independence. Terraforming engines pulse across barren worlds, fusion reactors power megastructures, and faster-than-light corridors open pathways to distant stars. Yet with this bold frontier come new tensions—resource demands skyrocket, politics fracture across planets, and alien microbial risks challenge human biology. The galaxy offers limitless opportunity, but one misstep can send civilisation spiraling into cosmic isolation or collapse. Every decision now echoes across multiple worlds.


Event: LEADERSHIP CRISIS — A scandal on Earth, a coup attempt on Mars, or an AI-governor malfunction shakes the stability of interstellar governance. Citizens across worlds question who truly leads humanity.

Launch a transparent investigation into the crisis with full public access.

Outcome: The speech resonates across colonies, restoring calm. Citizens appreciate clarity and renewed stability in government.


Event: INTERNAL CONFLICT — Rising tensions between genetically‑modified populations, baseline humans, AI citizens, and off‑world colonists ignite civil unrest.

Introduce anti‑discrimination laws across all colonies.

Outcome: The summits foster empathy and reveal shared hopes. Peaceful cooperation reemerges across planets.
