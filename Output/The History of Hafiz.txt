[Stone-Bronze Era]
Hafiz began as a small community surviving through simple tools, shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice shaped whether Hafiz could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.

A pivotal moment arrived when A season of scarcity descended upon Hafiz, testing unity as food and clean water sources dwindled.
To ensure long-term stability, the leaders of Hafiz sent a scouting party into distant wildlands to search for new sources of food.

Seeking a swift remedy, the leaders Appoint a highly respected non-political figure to temporarily oversee national operations.
Time would tell that Critics question the legitimacy of unelected authority. Protests erupt over democratic concerns, weakening societal cohesion.

Each decision carries amplified consequences, shaping whether Hafiz thrives among the stars or fractures under interplanetary pressures.
