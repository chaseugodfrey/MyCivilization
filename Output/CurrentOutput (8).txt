[Stone-Bronze Era]
Your civilisation stands at the threshold between primitive survival and organised society, guided by both practical instincts and the whispers of ancestral spirits.


Event: TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH - A new tool, technique, or discovery emerges. Innovation promises to elevate the tribe, but its impact depends on how the clans react.

Encourage artisans across clans to experiment with the technique.

Outcome: The demonstration fails dramatically — the tool breaks or the fire burns too hot. Doubt spreads through the tribe, and the inventors lose prestige before they can refine their craft.


Event: TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH - A new tool, technique, or discovery emerges. Innovation promises to elevate the tribe, but its impact depends on how the clans react.

Encourage artisans across clans to experiment with the technique.

Outcome: The demonstration captivates the tribe as young and old gather to watch. The innovation inspires excitement and unity as clans recognise its potential to improve daily life.


[Classical Era]
The Classical Era marks a turning point in your civilisation. City-states rise from once-simple settlements, roads bind regions together, and philosophy, mathematics, and organised armies become the tools of progress. Temples, forums, and academies shape the minds of leaders, while distant borders expand through diplomacy or conquest. Yet with greater power comes greater complexity—political rivalries deepen, citizens debate justice and order, and the state must balance prosperity with stability.


Event: LEADERSHIP CRISIS — Senators, generals, or governors challenge central authority. Power struggles threaten stability and endanger the unity of the classical state.

Rally the people through public speeches and civic demonstrations.

Outcome: Debates run long but produce a compromise that satisfies rival blocs. Citizens regain trust as the government demonstrates its ability to resolve crises through reason.


Event: CULTURAL SCHISM — Philosophers, generals, priests, and merchants clash over values and the direction of the state. Ideological divides threaten the harmony of the republic or kingdom.

Allow each faction temporary autonomy to follow its own customs.

Outcome: The forum becomes a celebration of reasoned discourse. Citizens feel heard, tempers ease, and the shared pursuit of knowledge rekindles unity across factions.


[Medieval Era]
The Medieval Era dawns on a world of fortified cities, noble houses, and sprawling kingdoms bound together by oaths, religion, and feudal obligations. Knights defend the realm, scholars preserve ancient knowledge in scriptoria, and merchants traverse growing trade routes. Yet the age is turbulent—rival lords feud for dominance, faith shapes politics, and common folk bear the weight of war, famine, and plague. How your civilisation balances duty, honour, and ambition will determine whether it thrives or falls into darkness.


Event: NATURAL DISASTER — A storm, plague of locusts, sudden freeze, or river flood strikes the kingdom. Villages cry for aid; the realm must respond quickly.

Order a realm-wide prayer vigil led by influential clergy.

Outcome: The reinforcements hold strong against the disaster, saving countless homes. Villagers praise the crown’s swift action and renewed sense of security.


Event: MORAL DILEMMA — A controversial case of justice, heresy, or peasant revolt forces the realm to choose between strict order and mercy. The decision will echo through legend.

Enforce strict punishment to demonstrate unwavering authority.

Outcome: The trial devolves into a spectacle of outrage. Shouting drowns out reason, and the final judgment satisfies no one, deepening division.


[Modern Era]
The Modern Era emerges with industrial power, scientific breakthroughs, and rapidly expanding global connections. Factories roar to life, cities climb skyward, and new ideologies shape the world’s political landscape. Nations compete for resources and influence, while ordinary citizens navigate unprecedented freedoms and pressures. Technological optimism clashes with social upheaval, and every decision tests the balance between progress, stability, and humanity’s future course.


Event: CULTURAL SCHISM — As communication accelerates and cities expand, ideological and cultural groups clash over identity, values, and national direction. Polarisation threatens to fracture the nation.

Create a nationwide volunteer program encouraging collaborative community service across factions.

Outcome: The televised debates become surprisingly respectful, with moderates emerging from both sides. Citizens appreciate seeing opposing views exchanged civilly, reducing tension nationwide.


Event: FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT — Diplomatic tensions spike after a border violation, cyberattack, or leaked intelligence. Nations watch closely as the situation threatens global stability.

Deploy military forces for strategic deterrence along contested borders.

Outcome: Diplomats manage to calm heated discussions, securing a ceasefire and restoring communication channels. The world praises your restraint and commitment to peace.


[Space Era]
Humanity stands at the dawn of interstellar expansion. Orbital shipyards glitter above Earth, lunar cities hum with industry, and the first colonies on Mars and Europa struggle toward independence. Terraforming engines pulse across barren worlds, fusion reactors power megastructures, and faster-than-light corridors open pathways to distant stars. Yet with this bold frontier come new tensions—resource demands skyrocket, politics fracture across planets, and alien microbial risks challenge human biology. The galaxy offers limitless opportunity, but one misstep can send civilisation spiraling into cosmic isolation or collapse. Every decision now echoes across multiple worlds.


Event: NATURAL DISASTER — A solar flare surge, terraforming failure, asteroid strike warning, or alien microbe outbreak threatens the stability of one or more colonies.

Deploy terraforming stabilizers to contain atmospheric or geological damage.

Outcome: The evacuation proceeds with precision. Millions are relocated safely, and gratitude strengthens interplanetary unity.


Event: NATURAL DISASTER — A solar flare surge, terraforming failure, asteroid strike warning, or alien microbe outbreak threatens the stability of one or more colonies.

Mobilise scientific task forces to study the event and prevent recurrence.

Outcome: The evacuation proceeds with precision. Millions are relocated safely, and gratitude strengthens interplanetary unity.
