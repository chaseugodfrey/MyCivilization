  mIntroMessage: <CityName> begins as a small community surviving through simple
    tools, shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork,
    and cautious exploration support daily life, but resources remain limited. Every
    choice shapes whether <CityName> grows into a stable settlement or struggles
    against scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: A fracture forms within <CityName> as the authority of the chieftain
    or elders is challenged. Doubt spreads quickly, and the people of <CityName>
    must reaffirm its direction.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Organise a Trial of Strength and Wisdom to select the rightful leader.
  - Ask the shamans to interpret omens to determine who the spirits favour.
  - Form a temporary Council of Clans to share leadership.
  - Host a Storytelling Night where elders recount past crises and wise leaders.
  - Allow the younger generation to select a representative to voice their concerns.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The trial unites the tribe as warriors and elders witness a fair contest. The
    victor earns universal respect, restoring confidence and providing the tribe
    with a renewed sense of direction.
  - The contest ends in accusations of cheating and bias. Supporters of multiple
    contenders refuse to accept the outcome, deepening the crisis and dividing the
    clans.
  - The shamans speak of hawks, fireflies, and river signs that point to a chosen
    leader. Their message resonates through the tribe, calming tensions and restoring
    spiritual trust.
  - "Competing shamans return with contradictory visions. Confusion spreads as clans
    take sides, each believing a different leader carries the spirits\u2019 blessing."
  - Representatives from every clan gather to guide the tribe together. Their shared
    decision-making stabilises the tribe and encourages cooperation through the crisis.
  - The council becomes paralyzed by constant disagreements. Every clan argues for
    its interests, leaving the tribe without clear direction as frustration grows.
  - Ancient tales remind the tribe of the strength found in unity. A respected elder
    emerges as a natural leader, inspiring trust and guiding the tribe forward.
  - The recounting of old conflicts reignites forgotten grudges. Elders argue over
    historical truth, worsening current tensions instead of healing them.
  - A thoughtful youth rises to speak for the young hunters and gatherers. His calm
    words bridge generations and help redirect the tribe toward cooperation.
  - The youth choose a brash warrior who inflames tensions. Older members see the
    choice as reckless, igniting disagreements between age groups.
