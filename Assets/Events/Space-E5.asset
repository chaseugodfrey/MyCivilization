  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extends its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel open
    new frontiers, but resources stretch thin and political interests diverge across
    worlds. Each decision carries amplified consequences, shaping whether <CityName>
    thrives among the stars or fractures under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: "TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH \u2014 A quantum AI discovery, new
    FTL refinement, or bioengineering revolution promises to reshape civilisation\u2014but
    its implications spark fierce debate."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Release the breakthrough technology to all colonies immediately.
  - Restrict access until full safety evaluations are complete.
  - Use the technology to upgrade key megastructures such as Dyson arrays and orbital
    elevators.
  - Share the discovery only with colonies facing economic or social instability.
  - Invite a council of human and AI scientists to determine ethical usage.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The discovery accelerates development across every world. Innovation flourishes
    as colonies unlock new potential, strengthening unity through shared advancement.
  - "Unequal adoption creates chaos\u2014wealthy colonies surge ahead while others
    fall behind. Protests erupt claiming systemic inequity."
  - The cautious approach pays off as hidden instabilities are discovered in testing.
    Lives and infrastructure are saved from potential catastrophe.
  - Colonies accuse the government of hoarding progress. Underground markets form,
    spreading unregulated and dangerous prototypes.
  - Megastructures leap in efficiency, boosting civilisation-wide energy output and
    transportation capacity. Hope spreads rapidly.
  - A calibration error destabilises a critical structure. Emergency containment
    drains resources and stokes public fear.
  - Targeted support revitalises struggling colonies. Their renewed prosperity stabilises
    regional tensions and earns deep gratitude.
  - Other colonies protest perceived favouritism. Rivalries intensify as political
    blocs form around the allocation decision.
  - The council produces a balanced, visionary charter. Citizens praise the transparency
    and long-term planning.
  - The council deadlocks, fueling cynicism. Fringe groups spread conspiracy theories
    claiming hidden agendas.
