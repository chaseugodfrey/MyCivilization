  mIntroMessage: <CityName> strengthens into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances expand
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshape its borders. Prosperity rises,
    but so do rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balances ambition
    and stability determines its path through this transformative age.
  mActionMessage: "MORAL DILEMMA \u2014 A controversy erupts over justice, law, or
    the treatment of minority groups. Restoring moral stability requires delicate
    leadership."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Hold a public tribunal with respected judges and philosophers.
  - Offer amnesty to minor offenders to de-escalate tensions.
  - Commission a new moral code written by philosophers and senators.
  - Empower local assemblies to resolve disputes autonomously.
  - Launch a civic virtue campaign promoting duty, honour, and unity.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The tribunal demonstrates a commitment to fairness and transparency. Citizens
    witness impartial reasoning and regain faith in the justice system.
  - The tribunal becomes a battleground for ideology. Judges are accused of bias,
    and crowds leave feeling more divided than before.
  - "Amnesty cools tempers and prevents unrest from spiralling. Citizens appreciate
    the state\u2019s mercy during turbulent times."
  - Citizens interpret amnesty as softness. Crime spikes as opportunists exploit
    weakened enforcement, undermining public confidence.
  - The new code provides clarity and restores order. Its principles resonate widely,
    and citizens feel united under a shared ethical framework.
  - "The drafting process becomes mired in political agendas. Senators sabotage each
    other\u2019s proposals, turning the code into a symbol of disunity."
  - Local involvement restores trust as communities solve issues directly. Citizens
    feel respected, easing widespread frustration.
  - Assemblies make contradictory rulings, creating legal chaos between districts.
    Citizens lose confidence in both local and central authority.
  - The campaign inspires citizens to act with restraint and compassion. Murals,
    speeches, and theatre performances revitalise shared cultural values.
  - Critics claim the campaign is propaganda. Artists and intellectuals rebel, turning
    the movement into a divisive cultural conflict.
