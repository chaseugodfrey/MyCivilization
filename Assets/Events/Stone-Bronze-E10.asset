  mIntroMessage: <CityName> begins as a small community surviving through simple
    tools, shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork,
    and cautious exploration support daily life, but resources remain limited. Every
    choice shapes whether <CityName> grows into a stable settlement or struggles
    against scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: A difficult ethical choice confronts the people of <CityName>,
    forcing its leaders to weigh tradition, survival, compassion, and long-term consequences.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Grant sanctuary to an injured outsider found near the village.
  - Refuse help to outsiders and strengthen borders to protect your own.
  - Ask the clans to vote collectively on the morally ambiguous issue.
  - Consult ancestral rites to determine the morally correct action.
  - Choose a pragmatic solution even if it challenges tradition.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The outsider recovers and proves to be skilled in crafting and gathering. Grateful
    for your compassion, they share knowledge that benefits the entire tribe and
    reinforces values of empathy.
  - "The outsider brings hidden danger \u2014 sickness, a vengeful clan, or treachery.
    Your goodwill backfires as the tribe pays the price for trusting an unknown stranger."
  - By focusing solely on internal strength, the tribe avoids external risks and
    reinforces its sense of identity. Resources remain plentiful for your people.
  - The tribe grows insular and fearful. Rumours spread of cruelty, damaging relations
    with neighbouring clans and weakening future alliances.
  - "The act of collective decision-making reinforces trust in community processes.
    Even those who disagree feel heard, strengthening the tribe\u2019s unity."
  - The vote divides the tribe sharply, creating winners and losers in a matter of
    principle. Resentment lingers long after the decision is made.
  - "The ritual provides clarity \u2014 a symbolic message or omen convinces the
    tribe of a righteous path. Shared faith becomes a guiding force, easing tension."
  - The ritual yields no clear sign, leading clans to interpret the silence differently.
    Conflicting beliefs erupt as each group insists their interpretation is true.
  - The bold choice leads to stability and improved survival, proving that adaptability
    can strengthen the tribe. Though not universally loved, the decision wins respect
    over time.
  - The abandonment of tradition upsets elders and spiritual leaders. The tribe becomes
    divided between those who embrace change and those who cling to ancient ways.
