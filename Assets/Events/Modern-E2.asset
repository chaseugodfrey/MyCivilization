  mIntroMessage: "CULTURAL SCHISM \u2014 As communication accelerates and cities
    expand, ideological and cultural groups clash over identity, values, and national
    direction. Polarisation threatens to fracture the nation."
  mActionMessage: "CULTURAL SCHISM \u2014 As communication accelerates and cities
    expand, ideological and cultural groups clash over identity, values, and national
    direction. Polarisation threatens to fracture the nation."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Host televised national dialogues between representatives of each faction.
  - Fund multicultural festivals to celebrate shared identity and diversity.
  - Commission sociologists and historians to produce public education material promoting
    common heritage.
  - Enforce stricter regulations on extremist organisations and harmful misinformation
    networks.
  - Create a nationwide volunteer program encouraging collaborative community service
    across factions.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The televised debates become surprisingly respectful, with moderates emerging
    from both sides. Citizens appreciate seeing opposing views exchanged civilly,
    reducing tension nationwide.
  - The debates devolve into combative shouting matches. Viral clips spread online
    portraying dysfunction, worsening ideological divides and eroding trust in institutions.
  - Communities gather for music, art, and cuisine in a rare show of unity. People
    rediscover common ground through celebration, and tensions cool as bonds deepen.
  - Organisers clash over representation, and protests erupt accusing the festival
    of cultural insensitivity. The event becomes a symbol of misguided government
    intervention.
  - Thoughtful documentaries and digital publications remind citizens of shared struggles
    and achievements. National pride grows, offering a sense of belonging across
    divides.
  - Critics accuse the material of bias or political agenda. Online backlash spreads
    rapidly, further polarising cultural groups and undermining academic authority.
  - Disrupting extremist groups restores safety and reduces ideological recruitment.
    Citizens feel protected from radicalisation, and public discourse becomes healthier.
  - Civil liberty groups decry the crackdown as censorship. Protests erupt over freedom-of-speech
    violations, and mistrust of the government intensifies.
  - Shared service projects break down stereotypes through cooperation. Participants
    form new friendships, and communities begin healing through collective effort.
  - Volunteers from rival groups clash during projects, reigniting hostilities. Social
    media sensationalises the incidents, undoing efforts toward unity.
