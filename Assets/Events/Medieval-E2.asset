  mIntroMessage: "CULTURAL SCHISM \u2014 Rival faiths, regional customs, and noble
    traditions clash, threatening the kingdom\u2019s unity. Priests, nobles, and
    common folk disagree over values that shape daily life."
  mActionMessage: "CULTURAL SCHISM \u2014 Rival faiths, regional customs, and noble
    traditions clash, threatening the kingdom\u2019s unity. Priests, nobles, and
    common folk disagree over values that shape daily life."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Hold a grand council between bishops, abbots, and regional priests.
  - Allow regions temporary freedom to follow local customs without interference.
  - Commission monks to create illuminated manuscripts promoting unity and shared
    heritage.
  - Introduce cultural festivals celebrating traditions from multiple regions.
  - "Send knights and heralds to travel the realm teaching the crown\u2019s ideals."
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The council resolves disputes peacefully, establishing shared doctrines that
    unify the clergy. Citizens feel reassured as harmony returns to religious life.
  - The council erupts into accusations of heresy. Bishops storm out, leaving the
    church fractured and the people uncertain who truly speaks for the divine.
  - Local pride strengthens as each community rediscovers its heritage. Freed from
    pressure, regional leaders voluntarily begin cooperating once more.
  - Autonomy deepens differences. Regions drift apart culturally, and rumours spread
    that the crown is losing influence over its own lands.
  - The manuscripts inspire awe with their artistry. They circulate widely, reminding
    nobles and common folk alike of their shared legacy.
  - Some nobles see the texts as propaganda and ban them from their halls. The effort
    backfires, stirring distrust toward the scriptoriums.
  - Villagers and nobles mingle joyfully during the festivals. Music, dance, and
    shared meals mend old grudges and renew the sense of belonging.
  - Rival performers and nobles take offense at how their cultures are represented.
    Fights break out, turning the festival into a spark for deeper rivalry.
  - "The knights\u2019 presence inspires admiration, and their message spreads quickly.
    People unite around the honour and duty associated with the crown."
  - Harsh enforcement by overzealous knights leads to resentment. Some communities
    refuse to host them, worsening tensions.
