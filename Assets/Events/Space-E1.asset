  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extends its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel open
    new frontiers, but resources stretch thin and political interests diverge across
    worlds. Each decision carries amplified consequences, shaping whether <CityName>
    thrives among the stars or fractures under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: "RESOURCE SHORTAGE \u2014 A critical shortage emerges: deuterium
    for fusion cores, helium-3 for lunar reactors, rare metals for shipyards, or
    water for colonies. Mining accidents, FTL disruptions, or diplomatic tension
    threaten stability across worlds."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Redirect mining fleets to a high-risk asteroid belt rich in rare materials.
  - Open emergency trade negotiations with independent Martian and Europa federations.
  - Activate orbital recycling arrays to repurpose derelict satellites and space
    debris.
  - Use military cargo cruisers to reroute essential supplies across FTL corridors.
  - Invest in a breakthrough synthetic material engineered in zero-gravity research
    labs.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The fleet successfully navigates the unstable belt, extracting massive mineral
    loads. Shipyards roar back to life, and colonists celebrate the swift recovery.
    Humanity feels unstoppable.
  - Unstable gravitational tides collapse several mining rigs. Lives are lost, production
    drops further, and colony governors demand accountability for the reckless gamble.
  - Despite historic tensions, the federations agree to sell surplus resources at
    fair prices. Diplomatic channels warm, and interplanetary cooperation reaches
    a new milestone.
  - Talks sour when Martian delegates accuse Earth of attempting economic manipulation.
    Trade routes tighten, and distrust spreads across the solar system.
  - Massive quantities of refined metals are reclaimed from orbital junkyards. Engineers
    hail it as the most efficient recycling operation in history, inspiring environmental
    confidence.
  - Unexpected debris trajectories cause collisions with active stations. Public
    outrage grows as orbital safety concerns escalate and salvage output plummets.
  - Military precision stabilises logistics instantly. Colonies receive life-sustaining
    shipments, and the fleet earns admiration for protecting civilian interests.
  - A cruiser miscalculates an FTL jump and disappears. Panic sweeps the colonies,
    and accusations of militarisation undermine public trust in leadership.
  - Scientists create a viable replacement for the missing resource. Production scales
    rapidly, positioning your civilisation as the technological leader of the galaxy.
  - The prototypes destabilise under atmospheric pressure, destroying the research
    facility. Funding collapses and confidence in off-world science wavers.
