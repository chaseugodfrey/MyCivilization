  mIntroMessage: RESOURCE SHORTAGE - Critical shortages of fusion fuel, terraforming
    compounds, rare alloys, or habitat supplies threaten stability.
  mActionMessage: RESOURCE SHORTAGE - Critical shortages of fusion fuel, terraforming
    compounds, rare alloys, or habitat supplies threaten stability.
  mOptionMessages:
  - Invest in widespread infrastructure improvements.
  - Open dialogue with affected groups to address concerns.
  - Deploy specialised teams to analyse and mitigate the issue.
  - Redirect national resources to aggressively solve the problem.
  - Allow local communities autonomy to handle the situation.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Orbital refineries, stabilised habitats, and upgraded fusion grids restore essential
    supplies.
  - Megastructure failures cascade, worsening shortages system-wide.
  - Colonies, stations, and fleets negotiate fair distribution across the network.
  - Talks deteriorate as regions accuse each other of resource hoarding.
  - Specialists locate new asteroid veins, fusion sources, and synthesizable compounds.
  - Scouting errors misidentify resources, wasting precious time.
  - Emergency redirection of fleets and transports restores near-term stability.
  - Critical sectors collapse from diverted shipments.
  - Autonomous colonies innovate recycling and production methods.
  - Fragmented solutions cause uneven stability across star systems.
