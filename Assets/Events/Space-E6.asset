  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: A solar flare surge, terraforming failure, asteroid strike warning,
    or alien microbe outbreak threatens the stability of one or more colonies.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Evacuate vulnerable colonies using FTL-capable relief vessels.
  - Activate planetary defense arrays to shield critical infrastructure.
  - Deploy terraforming stabilizers to contain atmospheric or geological damage.
  - Mobilise scientific task forces to study the event and prevent recurrence.
  - Seal affected colonies under temporary quarantine barriers.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The evacuation proceeds with precision. Millions are relocated safely, and gratitude
    strengthens interplanetary unity.
  - Evacuation corridors overload. Several ships become stranded mid-jump, causing
    panic and interplanetary outrage.
  - The planetary shields absorb catastrophic forces, preserving cities and research
    hubs. Engineers are celebrated for their heroism.
  - A shield overload causes grid-wide blackouts. Essential systems fail, leaving
    colonies vulnerable and fearful.
  - Stabilizers restore balance swiftly. Citizens praise the swift response and renewed
    confidence in planetary engineering.
  - A malfunction worsens the disaster. Terraforming systems spiral out of control,
    rendering entire regions uninhabitable.
  - Breakthrough insights emerge, improving defensive protocols and technology across
    every world.
  - Research delays frustrate colonists demanding immediate action. Trust erodes
    as debates stall critical solutions.
  - The swift isolation prevents the disaster from spreading across worlds. Citizens
    welcome the decisive containment.
  - "Colonies feel abandoned and revolt against containment measures. Civil unrest
    spreads system\u2011wide."
