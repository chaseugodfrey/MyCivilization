  mIntroMessage: <CityName> begins as a small community surviving through simple
    tools, shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork,
    and cautious exploration support daily life, but resources remain limited. Every
    choice shapes whether <CityName> grows into a stable settlement or struggles
    against scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: ECONOMIC BOOM - A sudden abundance of valuable resources brings
    prosperity, but risks pride, waste, and tension between clans.
  mOptionMessages:
  - Host a Festival of Plenty to celebrate and share the abundance.
  - Send artisans to craft intricate tools and ornaments from the surplus.
  - Establish a Trading Circle with neighbouring tribes.
  - "Store the surplus in clay\u2011lined pits and smokehouses for future safety."
  - Send settlers to explore and expand into newly promising regions.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The tribe feasts joyfully, exchanging goods and stories under torchlit skies.
    The celebration turns prosperity into unity, leaving clans hopeful for the future.
  - The festival grows excessive, and accusations arise that some clans contributed
    less or took more. What should have united instead stirs envy and bitterness.
  - "Stonecutters and carvers create works of beauty and precision. Their craftsmanship
    elevates the tribe\u2019s identity and inspires pride across all clans."
  - Artisans waste rare resources chasing unproven designs. Disputes erupt over ownership
    of the items, and the boom begins to feel mismanaged.
  - Trade brings new dyes, hides, tools, and stories into the settlement. Diplomacy
    strengthens as your tribe becomes a valued partner in regional exchange.
  - Rival tribes attempt to take advantage of the boom, demanding unfair trades or
    threatening raids. Prosperity becomes a political burden.
  - "New storage pits preserve food through harsh seasons, giving the tribe long\u2011term
    security. For the first time, the people imagine a stable future."
  - "Structural failures spoil a large portion of the preserved food. Shock and finger\u2011pointing
    spread as clans question the judgement behind the storage plan."
  - "Explorers return with tales of fertile valleys, rivers teeming with life, and
    new stone deposits. Their discoveries broaden the tribe\u2019s vision of its
    destiny."
  - "The distant lands prove treacherous, and many settlers never return. The losses
    shake the tribe\u2019s confidence and cast a shadow over the boom."
