  mIntroMessage: TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH - A new tool, technique, or discovery
    emerges. Innovation promises to elevate the tribe, but its impact depends on
    how the clans react.
  mActionMessage: TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH - A new tool, technique, or discovery
    emerges. Innovation promises to elevate the tribe, but its impact depends on
    how the clans react.
  mOptionMessages:
  - Allow the inventors to demonstrate the discovery before the whole tribe.
  - Encourage artisans across clans to experiment with the technique.
  - Declare the innovation sacred and entrust its use to the shamans.
  - Use the breakthrough to forge diplomatic offerings for neighbouring tribes.
  - Keep the discovery secret while exploring its full potential.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The demonstration captivates the tribe as young and old gather to watch. The
    innovation inspires excitement and unity as clans recognise its potential to
    improve daily life.
  - "The demonstration fails dramatically \u2014 the tool breaks or the fire burns
    too hot. Doubt spreads through the tribe, and the inventors lose prestige before
    they can refine their craft."
  - "Artisans from all clans refine the discovery, adding improvements and variations.
    Their cooperation elevates the tribe\u2019s craftsmanship far beyond its former
    limits."
  - Competition replaces cooperation as artisans accuse each other of theft and sabotage.
    The breakthrough becomes a source of rivalry rather than pride.
  - The shamans integrate the discovery into rituals, elevating its importance and
    giving it spiritual meaning. The tribe sees the breakthrough as a blessing from
    the ancestors.
  - Clans accuse the shamans of hoarding the tool for influence. Suspicion grows
    as spiritual authority and practical needs clash, creating subtle fractures.
  - Your artisans craft gifts that astonish neighbouring clans. Diplomacy strengthens
    as your tribe becomes known for skill and generosity, forging new alliances.
  - Rivals misinterpret the offerings as hidden threats. Diplomacy collapses as neighbouring
    tribes grow wary, suspecting manipulation or concealed power.
  - "Inventors refine the technique in secrecy until it becomes exceptionally powerful.
    When finally revealed, the discovery elevates the tribe\u2019s standing and capability
    dramatically."
  - Whispers spread about hidden knowledge and secret gatherings. Fear and paranoia
    destabilise trust between clans long before the truth is revealed.
