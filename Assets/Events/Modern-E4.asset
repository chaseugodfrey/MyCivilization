  mIntroMessage: Industrial growth reshapes society through machines, science, and
    rapid urbanisation. Nations compete for resources and influence, while citizens
    face new freedoms and pressures. Communication accelerates ideas, and political
    movements challenge old systems. Progress brings opportunity but also tension,
    forcing your civilisation to balance innovation with stability in an increasingly
    interconnected world.
  mActionMessage: "LEADERSHIP CRISIS \u2014 Scandals, disagreements, or sudden resignations
    shake the government. Confidence in leadership wavers as rivals manoeuvre for
    power."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Hold a fully transparent press conference to address accusations directly.
  - Form an emergency coalition with opposition parties to stabilise governance.
  - Appoint a highly respected non-political figure to temporarily oversee national
    operations.
  - Launch a public inquiry led by independent investigators.
  - Focus on foreign diplomacy to distract and stabilise both domestic and international
    relations.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "Clear answers restore trust, and the public appreciates the candor. Media outlets
    highlight the government\u2019s transparency, calming national anxiety."
  - The press conference spirals into hostile questioning. Poor responses go viral,
    worsening the scandal and deepening distrust.
  - A united leadership presents a calm front. Policies pass efficiently, demonstrating
    political maturity and reducing partisan tensions.
  - Ideological clashes paralyse decision-making. The coalition crumbles quickly,
    sparking even greater leadership vacuum and public frustration.
  - A revered judge, scientist, or humanitarian restores public confidence. Citizens
    feel reassured by a neutral expert guiding the nation through crisis.
  - Critics question the legitimacy of unelected authority. Protests erupt over democratic
    concerns, weakening societal cohesion.
  - The investigation uncovers truth and holds guilty parties accountable. Public
    support surges as justice is seen to prevail over corruption.
  - Political allies resist the inquiry, leading to accusations of cover-ups. The
    process becomes politicised, further eroding confidence.
  - "Successful negotiations and treaties shift public focus to national achievements
    abroad. Admiration rises for your leadership\u2019s global competence."
  - Citizens accuse the government of avoiding domestic issues. Headlines proclaim
    the strategy as escapism, intensifying political distrust.
