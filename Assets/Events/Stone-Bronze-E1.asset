  mIntroMessage: <CityName> begins as a small community surviving through simple
    tools, shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork,
    and cautious exploration support daily life, but resources remain limited. Every
    choice shapes whether <CityName> grows into a stable settlement or struggles
    against scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: A season of scarcity descends upon <CityName>, testing unity as
    food, stone, and natural bounty dwindle.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - "Send a hunting\u2013scouting band into distant wildlands."
  - Perform a ritual of offering to the earth spirits.
  - Consolidate resources by merging multiple clan stores temporarily.
  - Attempt early bronze forging to craft better tools from scarce ores.
  - Nomadically relocate a portion of the tribe to follow migrating herds.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The scouting band returns carrying new stone samples, maps of fertile groves,
    and stories of distant herds. Their discoveries ease the tribe\u2019s anxiety
    and create fresh opportunities for settlement. The people celebrate their bravery
    beneath torchlight."
  - The scouts vanish into the deep wilds, never returning. Their absence casts a
    shadow across the tribe, and parents forbid their children from wandering far
    as fear spreads and scarcity tightens its grip.
  - "The ritual kindles hope throughout the tribe as the shamans chant into the night.
    Rain falls lightly the next morning, revealing fresh roots and softening the
    soil\u2014many believe the spirits have shown mercy."
  - Despite elaborate rites, the land remains barren. Some accuse the shamans of
    losing their connection to the spirits, heightening tensions among clans already
    anxious about survival.
  - Clans place their stores together inside a great longhouse, guarded by representatives
    from each family. The shared responsibility rekindles unity, ensuring that even
    meagre portions stretch farther than before.
  - Mistrust brews when a stash of dried meat goes missing. Accusations erupt, and
    the fragile alliance fractures overnight as suspicion replaces cooperation.
  - Through trial and error, artisans manage to smelt a small batch of crude bronze.
    The durable tools they forge restore productivity, allowing hunters and gatherers
    to work efficiently despite the scarcity.
  - "The forging attempt ends in disaster\u2014molten metal spills as the pit cracks,
    injuring workers and wasting precious ore. Fear spreads that the tribe is meddling
    with forces they don\u2019t yet understand."
  - The migrating group establishes temporary camps and returns with cured meats
    and hides. Their success reduces local strain and inspires stories of promising
    distant valleys.
  - Harsh weather and failed hunts devastate the migrating group. Only a few return,
    wounded and shaken, warning that wandering too far may doom the tribe.
