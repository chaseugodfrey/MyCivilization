  mIntroMessage: <CityName> entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes,
    and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened
    stability. Survival depended on how <CityName> navigated obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: A mysterious sickness spreads through towns and villages. Healers,
    priests, and common folk struggle to understand and survive the affliction.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Order quarantines in afflicted districts and restrict travel.
  - Support apothecaries and herbalists in experimenting with remedies.
  - Organise mass prayer processions and offerings for divine mercy.
  - Establish dedicated infirmaries staffed by trained healers and clergy.
  - Suspend certain taxes and tithes to ease the burden on afflicted communities.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Though harsh, the restrictions slow the spread considerably. People see the crown
    as willing to make difficult choices to protect the realm.
  - Trade grinds to a halt and separated families despair. Black markets emerge,
    undermining both the quarantine and trust in royal decrees.
  - Some mixtures ease symptoms and reduce mortality. Word of these treatments spreads,
    lifting spirits and showcasing the value of learned healers.
  - Unproven mixtures cause harm in some cases. Rumours of poison turn fear toward
    the healers themselves, complicating efforts to respond.
  - The processions bring people together in shared grief and hope. Their renewed
    faith helps them endure hardship with greater resilience.
  - Crowded gatherings spread infection further. When no immediate miracle follows,
    anger turns against both priests and the ruling house.
  - Centralising care allows better organisation and treatment. The infirmaries become
    places of both healing and compassion, and survival rates improve.
  - Resources prove insufficient, and the infirmaries overflow with the sick. Despair
    grows as people view them as houses of death rather than hope.
  - The relief allows families to focus on survival rather than debt. Gratitude toward
    the crown and clergy grows, even in dark times.
  - "The reduced income weakens the crown\u2019s ability to fund responses. Some
    nobles complain bitterly, causing new friction among the leadership."
