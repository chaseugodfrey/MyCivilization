  mIntroMessage: Humanity expands beyond Earth into orbital stations, lunar cities,
    and early colonies. Advanced reactors, terraforming, and faster-than-light travel
    open new frontiers, but resource strain and political fragmentation grow across
    planets. Each settlement faces unique risks, and decisions now carry consequences
    stretching far beyond a single world or generation.
  mActionMessage: "FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT \u2014 A diplomatic crisis erupts involving
    a newly contacted alien species or a dispute between independent human colonies."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Send a multilingual diplomatic envoy including AI translators.
  - Strengthen orbital defenses while maintaining an open diplomatic channel.
  - Propose a shared research treaty to build trust.
  - Hold a system-wide referendum on the diplomatic approach.
  - Conduct a show of force by flying a fleet through contested space.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The envoy impresses with empathy and clarity. Tensions cool as communication
    barriers dissolve, opening new alliances.
  - A mistranslation sparks misunderstanding. Talks collapse and relations deteriorate
    rapidly.
  - This balanced approach discourages aggression without provoking it. Colonies
    commend your strategic wisdom.
  - The maneuver is interpreted as hostile posturing. The opposing faction mobilises
    fleets in response.
  - Cooperative projects flourish, leading to technological breakthroughs and cultural
    exchange. A new golden age of diplomacy dawns.
  - Rivals view the treaty as unequal or manipulative. The initiative collapses,
    worsening suspicion.
  - The referendum unifies citizens under a shared mandate. Public engagement strengthens
    governance.
  - The vote reveals deep social fractures. Opposing camps grow hostile, worsening
    internal instability.
  - The bold display intimidates rivals into backing down. Colonies praise the decisive
    action.
  - A vessel misfires during maneuvers, escalating the crisis. Armed conflict appears
    imminent.
