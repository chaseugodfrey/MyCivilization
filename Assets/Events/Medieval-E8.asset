  mIntroMessage: "INTERNAL CONFLICT \u2014 Rival noble houses, feuding villages,
    or competing guilds strain the kingdom\u2019s unity. Without careful intervention,
    quarrels may ignite into open violence."
  mActionMessage: "INTERNAL CONFLICT \u2014 Rival noble houses, feuding villages,
    or competing guilds strain the kingdom\u2019s unity. Without careful intervention,
    quarrels may ignite into open violence."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Convene a tribunal where disputing lords present their cases before the crown.
  - Dispatch a neutral order of knights to enforce peace in contested regions.
  - "Fund joint projects\u2014bridges, mills, or markets\u2014that require cooperation
    between rivals."
  - Invite clerics to mediate and preach reconciliation.
  - Temporarily separate feuding groups by redrawing minor jurisdictions.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The tribunal gives all sides a formal voice. Wise judgments and fair compromise
    restore respect for the throne, and the nobles disperse with grievances largely
    settled.
  - The tribunal reveals deep grudges that neither side will abandon. Accusations
    of bias follow, and some lords leave more resentful than when they arrived.
  - "The knights\u2019 disciplined presence deters rash violence. Villagers and lesser
    nobles breathe easier, grateful for the restored security."
  - The knights are drawn into local rivalries and appear to favour one side. Their
    presence inflames tensions instead of quelling them.
  - Shared investment gradually mends distrust as both sides profit from the completed
    works. Economic benefit becomes a bridge over old wounds.
  - Arguments over cost, labour, and ownership stall construction. The unfinished
    projects stand as monuments to failure, deepening bitterness.
  - Respected clergy remind all parties of higher ideals, softening hearts. Their
    sermons inspire sincere attempts at forgiveness and renewed cooperation.
  - Some lords accuse clerics of taking sides, turning faith into another battleground.
    Religious authority suffers as the conflict grows more personal.
  - The enforced distance reduces immediate clashes and buys time for tempers to
    cool. Order returns, and isolated communities slowly refocus on daily life.
  - The new boundaries anger those who lose influence or land. Whispered conspiracies
    multiply, and resentment simmers just beneath the surface.
