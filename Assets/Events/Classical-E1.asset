  mIntroMessage: RESOURCE SHORTAGE - Despite the splendour of the Classical age,
    scarcity threatens civilisation as drought, failing mines, or disrupted trade
    routes strain supplies and test public confidence.
  mActionMessage: RESOURCE SHORTAGE - Despite the splendour of the Classical age,
    scarcity threatens civilisation as drought, failing mines, or disrupted trade
    routes strain supplies and test public confidence.
  mOptionMessages:
  - Redirect state labour to restore farmlands and irrigation canals.
  - Send envoys to neighbouring kingdoms to secure emergency trade shipments.
  - Impose temporary rationing laws enforced by city magistrates.
  - Expand mining operations into unexplored hills and quarries.
  - Appeal to philosophers and scholars to devise new efficiency methods.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "Farmers and engineers restore ancient canals and expand irrigation networks.
    Crops begin to recover as water returns to the fields, reassuring citizens that
    the state remains capable of protecting their livelihood. Public confidence rises
    in the government\u2019s competence."
  - Labourers clash with landowners over property rights, delaying repairs. Seasonal
    rains arrive too late, and the fields fail to recover. Citizens accuse the government
    of mismanaging both manpower and time.
  - "Diplomats return with favourable agreements, acquiring grain and metals at a
    modest cost. Foreign merchants praise your civilisation\u2019s stability, and
    the relief shipments calm unrest in the capital."
  - "Envoys are rebuffed or exploited; rival rulers sense desperation and demand
    outrageous terms. Caravans return empty, and citizens grow suspicious of foreign
    powers and the state\u2019s diplomacy."
  - Though strict, the rationing system ensures fair distribution. Citizens, seeing
    equal sacrifice across all classes, accept the decree and unite under a renewed
    sense of civic duty.
  - Magistrates abuse their authority, hoarding supplies for elites. Riots break
    out in poorer districts, and rumours of corruption spread faster than food. Rationing
    becomes a symbol of state failure.
  - Surveyors uncover rich veins of ore that invigorate industry and trade. The discovery
    sparks optimism as artisans and smiths resume full-scale production, strengthening
    the economy.
  - The new mines prove barren or dangerous. Several collapses cause casualties,
    angering families and triggering investigations into negligence. Productivity
    drops further under fear and mourning.
  - Academics propose innovative storage, agricultural, and distribution practices.
    Their ideas spread quickly through cities and farms, inspiring reforms that stretch
    resources further than expected.
  - Scholars disagree bitterly, and their theoretical debates solve nothing. Citizens
    mock the intellectual class for being out of touch, widening the divide between
    thinkers and labourers.
