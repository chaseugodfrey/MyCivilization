  mIntroMessage: <CityName> enters an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shapes governance, merchants connect distant routes,
    and scholars preserve knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threaten
    stability. Survival depends on how <CityName> navigates obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
