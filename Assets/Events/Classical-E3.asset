  mIntroMessage: "City-states strengthen into structured societies with laws, philosophy,
    and organised armies. Roads connect regions, trade expands, and public institutions
    shape citizens\u2019 lives. Diplomacy and conquest redefine borders, while political
    tension grows beneath newly won prosperity. Ideas spread faster than stability,
    testing how your civilisation balances ambition, order, and the pursuit of knowledge."
  mActionMessage: "ECONOMIC BOOM \u2014 A surge in trade, production, or discovery
    brings sudden wealth. Prosperity elevates the state but may also fuel extravagance
    or internal competition."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Host a grand festival celebrating prosperity and civic achievement.
  - Invest surplus wealth into expanding libraries and academies.
  - Expand trade fleets and merchant caravans to amplify returns.
  - Reduce taxes temporarily to encourage economic movement.
  - Commission new roads, aqueducts, and public structures.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Citizens gather in theatres, plazas, and markets to celebrate shared success.
    The festival strengthens civic pride and reminds all that prosperity belongs
    to everyone.
  - The festival becomes overly lavish, draining treasuries and angering poorer citizens
    who see the wealth gap widening. Resentment spreads beneath the celebrations.
  - New academies attract scholars from distant lands. Knowledge flourishes, advancements
    multiply, and the state's prestige rises among neighbouring civilisations.
  - Funds are mismanaged or stolen. Construction halts, scholars depart, and citizens
    accuse officials of corruption, casting suspicion over the entire boom.
  - Trade routes flourish as caravans return with exotic goods, rare metals, and
    lucrative deals. Wealth flows steadily, solidifying the state's growing influence.
  - Pirates and bandits target your expanded trade routes. Several shipments vanish,
    triggering panic among merchants and destabilizing the once-thriving economy.
  - "Lower taxes invigorate commerce. Citizens praise the government\u2019s generosity,
    and markets flourish as artisans, farmers, and traders thrive."
  - Revenue drops too sharply, weakening military upkeep and public services. Citizens
    begin doubting the state's ability to balance generosity with responsibility.
  - Infrastructure expands dramatically, creating jobs and transforming the urban
    landscape. Future generations will benefit from the flourishing civic projects.
  - Overambitious projects overextend resources, leaving many structures unfinished.
    Citizens ridicule the failed monuments as signs of leadership hubris.
