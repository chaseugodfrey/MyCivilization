  mIntroMessage: Industrial change reshapes <CityName> with new technologies, expanding
    factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenge old systems,
    while global trade raises both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerates faster
    than society adapts, and <CityName> must balance progress with stability as it
    confronts competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.
  mActionMessage: "RESOURCE SHORTAGE \u2014 A supply crisis hits the nation as fuel,
    materials, or essential goods run scarce due to embargoes, industrial failures,
    or global disruption. Factories stall, transport slows, and citizens grow anxious."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Implement emergency fuel and energy rationing across major cities.
  - Negotiate an urgent trade deal with foreign suppliers for essential materials.
  - Launch a national recycling and reclamation initiative to stretch existing resources.
  - Divert military logistics and transport fleets to support civilian supply distribution.
  - Fund emergency research to engineer synthetic alternatives to the scarce resource.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Rationing slows consumption enough to stabilise the grid. Citizens appreciate
    the fairness of the distribution system, and engineers gain time to redirect
    power to essential services. Factories resume limited but steady operations.
  - Public frustration boils over as long queues and blackouts spread. Social media
    amplifies complaints, and protests erupt demanding government accountability.
    Order becomes harder to maintain.
  - Diplomats secure a favourable contract after tense negotiation. Cargo ships arrive
    within days, restocking industries and calming markets. Global partners praise
    your nation's reliability under pressure.
  - Foreign powers demand costly concessions involving tariffs, patents, or political
    alignment. The deal arrives too late or too expensive, triggering public anger
    and weakening your international standing.
  - Industries creatively repurpose scrap materials, sparking innovation in manufacturing.
    Citizens embrace the campaign enthusiastically, reducing strain on supply chains.
    A surprising cultural movement forms around sustainability.
  - "The program collapses under poor organisation, leading to contaminated materials
    and inefficient recovery. Critics ridicule the government\u2019s 'performative
    environmentalism,' damaging credibility."
  - "The military\u2019s precision and discipline restore order in shipping routes.
    Deliveries become reliable again, and citizens praise the decisive action prioritising
    public welfare over bureaucracy."
  - The presence of military personnel in civilian hubs sparks unease. Accusations
    of intimidation and overreach spread, and mishandled checkpoints cause delays
    rather than improvements.
  - Scientists rapidly produce a workable substitute. Industries adopt it quickly,
    transforming the crisis into a technological triumph. Your nation becomes a world
    leader in alternative materials.
  - The research burns through money with little progress. Headlines mock the 'million-dollar
    miracle that never came,' and funding scandals erode trust in scientific institutions.
