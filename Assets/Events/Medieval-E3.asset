  mIntroMessage: "ECONOMIC BOOM \u2014 Prosperity surges as trade expands and new
    resources flow into the kingdom. Wealth spreads, but so does the temptation toward
    greed and excess."
  mActionMessage: "ECONOMIC BOOM \u2014 Prosperity surges as trade expands and new
    resources flow into the kingdom. Wealth spreads, but so does the temptation toward
    greed and excess."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Expand merchant guild privileges to encourage further trade.
  - Commission new stone roads to connect distant towns.
  - Host a grand market fair inviting merchants from across the continent.
  - Lower taxes to reward citizens for their hard work.
  - Construct new granaries and treasuries to secure surplus wealth.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Merchants flourish under new freedoms, returning with exotic goods and vast profits.
    Prosperity spreads even into remote villages, uplifting morale across the kingdom.
  - Guilds become arrogant and begin exploiting smaller traders. Corruption spreads
    through the markets, turning prosperity into resentment.
  - The new roads increase safety and speed for travelers. Trade booms further, and
    the crown is praised for fostering long-term growth.
  - "Construction overruns drain the treasury. Nobles argue over road routes, delaying
    progress and souring the public\u2019s feelings about the project."
  - The fair becomes a dazzling success, attracting traders from faraway lands. Knowledge,
    goods, and culture intermix, enriching the entire realm.
  - "A fire breaks out during the fair, destroying goods and spreading fear. Merchants
    flee, vowing never to return, damaging your realm\u2019s reputation."
  - A wave of relief sweeps through towns and villages. Happy citizens invest more
    freely, further boosting economic success.
  - With reduced taxes, the crown struggles to fund essential services. Nobles grow
    anxious about weakened defenses and rising instability.
  - "The kingdom becomes a model of foresight, storing prosperity for future hardship.
    Citizens appreciate the ruler\u2019s wisdom."
  - Heavy investment leaves little gold for emergencies. When minor mishaps occur,
    the crown appears unprepared despite its wealth.
