  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: Tensions had risen between the people of <CityName> due to disputes
    over personal grievances. Without intervention from it's leaders, violence was
    close to erupting.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Host a mediation circle where clan leaders speak openly. <CityName>
  - Propose a labour-sharing project requiring clans to work together. <CityName>
  - Host a symbolic offering ceremony to appease ancestral spirits. <CityName>
  - Assign neutral elders to judge disputes impartially. <CityName>
  - Encourage a feast where clans share food and stories. <CityName>
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Leaders gather around the central fire, voicing frustrations and misunderstandings.
    Through patient dialogue, they rediscover shared goals and agree to renewed cooperation.
  - Discussions escalate into shouting as old grudges resurface. The circle dissolves
    in hostility, worsening the divide and deepening mistrust.
  - Building shelters, digging pits, or crafting tools side by side helps clans reconnect.
    Cooperation rekindles a sense of unity as shared labour mends emotional fractures.
  - Clans disagree over workload and credit. Accusations of laziness or sabotage
    emerge, transforming the project into a battleground of resentment.
  - Clans join in sacred rituals, offering carvings, herbs, and crafted items. The
    shared spiritual moment softens hearts and reminds them of their ancient common
    roots.
  - Some clans dismiss the ceremony as meaningless, sparking further disagreement.
    Participation becomes a point of pride or defiance, worsening the internal divide.
  - Respected elders carefully review grievances, delivering fair rulings accepted
    by most. Their wisdom calms the situation and restores a sense of justice.
  - Clans claim the elders favour certain families, rejecting their judgments. The
    authority of the elders weakens, intensifying the conflict instead of resolving
    it.
  - A communal feast rekindles bonds as clans trade stories and songs. Laughter replaces
    bitterness, reminding everyone of the ties that bind the tribe together.
  - Arguments erupt over food distribution or seating arrangements. What was meant
    as reconciliation becomes another flashpoint for division.
