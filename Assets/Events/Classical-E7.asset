  mIntroMessage: "FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT \u2014 A diplomatic dispute, border
    provocation, or misunderstood action from a neighbouring civilisation threatens
    peace."
  mActionMessage: "FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT \u2014 A diplomatic dispute, border
    provocation, or misunderstood action from a neighbouring civilisation threatens
    peace."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Send diplomats bearing tribute and requests for peaceful negotiation.
  - Stage a grand military parade to demonstrate strength without declaring war.
  - Invite foreign philosophers, merchants, and dignitaries to cultural exchange
    events.
  - Increase border patrols and fortify frontier outposts.
  - Host competitive games between your finest athletes and theirs.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Diplomats are received warmly, and tribute softens foreign attitudes. A new treaty
    forms, easing tensions and restoring diplomatic balance.
  - The offering is rejected as weakness. The neighbouring state grows more hostile,
    seeing an opportunity to pressure your borders.
  - The parade impresses foreign envoys and reassures citizens. The show of power
    deters further provocations while maintaining peace.
  - Foreign leaders misinterpret the display as preparation for war. Tensions escalate
    as both sides increase military readiness.
  - "The exchange softens relations as visitors enjoy hospitality and witness your
    civilisation\u2019s achievements. Trade and dialogue flourish."
  - Cultural misunderstandings ignite offence. Debates turn heated, and dignitaries
    leave insulted, worsening the crisis.
  - Stronger defences discourage incursions, allowing diplomats time to resolve disputes.
    Citizens feel safer knowing the state is vigilant.
  - A minor border encounter turns violent, triggering retaliation. The region destabilises,
    and the threat of war intensifies.
  - The shared games build camaraderie as athletes bond across borders. Friendly
    rivalry replaces hostility, renewing trust between nations.
  - National pride sparks conflict; accusations of cheating spiral out of control.
    Diplomatic relations worsen as the games end in discord.
