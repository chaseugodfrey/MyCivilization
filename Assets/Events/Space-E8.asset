  mIntroMessage: POPULATION SURGE - Rapid colony expansion strains life-support,
    housing, and supply lines.
  mActionMessage: POPULATION SURGE - Rapid colony expansion strains life-support,
    housing, and supply lines.
  mOptionMessages:
  - Invest in widespread infrastructure improvements.

  - Allow local communities autonomy to handle the situation.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Expanded habitats, life-support grids, and transit systems support growth.
  - Rushed construction collapses under strain.
  - Public forums coordinate sustainable use of resources.
  - Conflicts erupt over access to life-support capacity.
  - Engineers plan efficient orbital and planetary expansion.
  - Faulty designs escalate overcrowding and instability.
  - Resource redirection rapidly expands housing and supply lines.
  - Funding shortages leave half-finished habitat sections.
  - Colonies adapt autonomously with creative growth models.
  - Uneven expansion fuels inter-settlement conflict.
