  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Citizens marvel at the engineering display as the invention proves reliable and
    transformative. Confidence in state innovation grows, inspiring new waves of
    curiosity and ambition.
  - "The demonstration fails dramatically\u2014devices malfunction or collapse. The
    public's embarrassment turns to doubt, weakening faith in the state's technological
    leadership."
  - Scholars improve theoretical models while artisans perfect practical designs.
    The innovation becomes a polished achievement, boosting both prestige and productivity.
  - Scholars clash over methodology while artisans argue over credit. The project
    stagnates as collaboration breaks down, delaying progress and draining resources.
  - Generals integrate the breakthrough into strategic planning, giving your army
    a decisive advantage. Citizens feel safer knowing the state guards them with
    superior knowledge.
  - The invention proves unstable in combat trials. A catastrophic failure injures
    soldiers, stirring backlash against reckless experimentation.
  - Academies flourish as students and thinkers expand upon the new discovery. A
    cultural renaissance blooms, elevating your civilisation's intellectual prestige.
  - Widespread access sparks plagiarism, competition, and disputes among scholars.
    Rival academies accuse each other of theft, eroding academic unity.
