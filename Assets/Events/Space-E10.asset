  mIntroMessage: "MORAL DILEMMA \u2014 A sentient AI whistleblower, alien refugee
    crisis, or controversial scientific revelation forces humanity to confront its
    ethical foundations."
  mActionMessage: "MORAL DILEMMA \u2014 A sentient AI whistleblower, alien refugee
    crisis, or controversial scientific revelation forces humanity to confront its
    ethical foundations."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Hold an interstellar tribunal with representatives from all species and AI groups.
  - "Grant immediate asylum to affected populations\u2014human, alien, or synthetic."
  - Enforce strict containment of all subjects until facts are verified.
  - Commission an ethics AI trained on millennia of philosophical data.
  - "Organise a galaxy\u2011wide digital referendum to decide on the issue."
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The tribunal becomes a beacon of fairness across the galaxy. Its ruling sets
    a new ethical standard admired by all factions.
  - The tribunal fractures along ideological lines. Rival delegations accuse each
    other of corruption, worsening tensions.
  - "The humanitarian gesture inspires admiration. Refugees integrate successfully
    and enrich civilisation\u2019s diversity."
  - Opposition groups claim resources are overstretched. Growing resentment triggers
    protests on multiple worlds.
  - Containment allows investigators to uncover critical truths. The crisis resolves
    with newfound clarity and stability.
  - "Containment is viewed as oppression. Civil liberties groups rally millions in
    system\u2011wide demonstrations."
  - The AI produces balanced moral frameworks that guide civilisation toward sustainable
    unity. Citizens embrace its wisdom.
  - "Populations distrust the idea of machine\u2011defined morality. The debate fractures
    society between pro\u2011AI and anti\u2011AI camps."
  - The referendum empowers every citizen. The final vote creates a shared mandate
    that strengthens democratic cohesion.
  - Hackers compromise portions of the vote. Trust in governance collapses as accusations
    of illegitimacy dominate the discourse.
