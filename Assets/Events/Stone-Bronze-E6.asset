  mIntroMessage: "NATURAL DISASTER - A violent storm, flood, drought, or earth-shaking
    event disrupts the tribe\u2019s daily life, threatening safety and survival."
  mActionMessage: "NATURAL DISASTER - A violent storm, flood, drought, or earth-shaking
    event disrupts the tribe\u2019s daily life, threatening safety and survival."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Construct emergency earth-and-wood shelters to protect the tribe.
  - Send scouts to seek safer high ground or untouched groves.
  - Ask shamans to perform protective rites to calm the raging spirits.
  - Divide the tribe into task-groups to protect food, homes, and children.
  - Retreat temporarily into sacred caves believed to be blessed by ancestors.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Working through wind and rain, families raise sturdy shelters reinforced with
    clay and timber. The structures hold firm, saving lives and giving the tribe
    a fragile but vital sense of security.
  - "Despite desperate effort, the shelters collapse under the storm\u2019s fury.
    Injuries mount and valuable supplies are lost, deepening fear and exposing the
    tribe\u2019s vulnerability."
  - "The scouts return with news of a sheltered ridge where the storm\u2019s reach
    weakens. The tribe relocates just in time, weathering the disaster with minimal
    loss and renewed gratitude."
  - The scouts misjudge the land, leading the tribe into an exposed hollow. The storm
    intensifies, bringing devastating floods that shatter morale and resources.
  - Chants echo across the village as flames crackle in ritual pits. The storm seems
    to ease briefly, giving the tribe precious moments to regroup and restore order.
  - The rites fail to bring relief. Some clans blame the shamans for angering the
    spirits further, and fear quickly turns to mistrust and blame among families.
  - "Every clan works with fierce determination\u2014some reinforcing shelters, others
    guarding stores or carrying the vulnerable to safety. Cooperation in crisis strengthens
    unity."
  - Task-groups clash over priorities, creating chaos instead of order. Precious
    time is wasted in arguments, allowing the disaster to inflict deeper damage.
  - The caves withstand the storm, their walls etched with ancient symbols that comfort
    the tribe. Survival becomes a spiritual triumph, reinforcing belief in ancestral
    protection.
  - The caves flood unexpectedly, forcing a panicked escape. The tribe suffers injuries
    and morale plummets as once-revered shelters are revealed to be perilous.
