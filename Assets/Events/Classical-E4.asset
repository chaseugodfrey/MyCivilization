  mIntroMessage: "LEADERSHIP CRISIS \u2014 Senators, generals, or governors challenge
    central authority. Power struggles threaten stability and endanger the unity
    of the classical state."
  mActionMessage: "LEADERSHIP CRISIS \u2014 Senators, generals, or governors challenge
    central authority. Power struggles threaten stability and endanger the unity
    of the classical state."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Call an emergency senate session to negotiate power disputes.
  - Empower a respected general to temporarily unify command.
  - Rally the people through public speeches and civic demonstrations.
  - Establish a council of philosophers to guide decision-making.
  - Offer amnesty to rebels and dissenters who pledge loyalty to the state.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Debates run long but produce a compromise that satisfies rival blocs. Citizens
    regain trust as the government demonstrates its ability to resolve crises through
    reason.
  - The senate erupts into chaos as factions accuse each other of treason. Negotiations
    fail, and the public witnesses a humiliating collapse of political order.
  - The general restores discipline with swift authority. Military order stabilises
    the state, preventing unrest from consuming the capital.
  - The general oversteps, gaining too much influence. Citizens fear a slide toward
    tyranny, and senators plot in secret to counter the growing threat.
  - Citizens gather in plazas to hear inspiring speeches. Their renewed patriotism
    pressures political rivals into cooperation, restoring balance in the state.
  - Crowds become unpredictable, and demonstrations turn violent. Opposing factions
    exploit the unrest, dragging the state deeper into instability.
  - The philosopher-council offers measured, ethical solutions that impress both
    citizens and leaders. Their wisdom helps defuse political tensions.
  - Philosophers disagree publicly, revealing ideological divides that embarrass
    the state. Citizens mock the council as elite dreamers disconnected from real
    governance.
  - "The offer draws many dissenters back into the fold, reducing the risk of civil
    conflict. Citizens praise the leadership\u2019s mercy and foresight."
  - "Some rebels feign loyalty while plotting in secret. The state\u2019s leniency
    is interpreted as weakness, emboldening those who seek to overthrow central authority."
