  mIntroMessage: <CityName> had strengthened into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and a growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances had expanded
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshaped its borders. Prosperity had
    risen, but so had rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balanced
    ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative
    age.
  mActionMessage: Philosophers, generals, priests, and merchants clash over values
    and the direction of the state. Ideological divides threaten the harmony of the
    republic.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Host a public forum where citizens debate openly under magistrate supervision.
  - Commission respected philosophers to write doctrines promoting unity.
  - Hold athletic festivals to shift focus from ideology to shared civic pride.
  - Invite religious leaders to mediate philosophical disputes.
  - Allow each faction temporary autonomy to follow its own customs.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The forum becomes a celebration of reasoned discourse. Citizens feel heard, tempers
    ease, and the shared pursuit of knowledge rekindles unity across factions.
  - The forum spirals into shouting and personal attacks. Factions leave more entrenched
    than before, and the forum becomes a symbol of civic dysfunction.
  - The doctrines spread through academies and marketplaces, persuading citizens
    that harmony strengthens the state. A new cultural revival follows.
  - Rival schools of thought dispute the doctrines, each claiming the others distort
    truth. Citizens divide along intellectual lines, deepening the schism.
  - Athletes from every region compete honorably, and crowds cheer as one people.
    The spectacle renews civic pride and distracts from ideological conflicts.
  - The games highlight regional rivalries instead of easing them. Accusations of
    cheating ignite fights, converting celebration into chaos.
  - Religious leaders help bridge differing values, emphasizing moral principles
    shared across groups. Their guidance brings calm and renewed respect for tradition.
  - Priests favour certain factions, sparking accusations of corruption. Religious
    authority fractures, amplifying the ideological conflict.
  - "Granting space reduces immediate tension, and citizens appreciate the state\u2019s
    flexibility. Over time, factions find common ground through voluntary cooperation."
  - Autonomy deepens ideological separation. Factions grow rigid, developing distinct
    identities that undermine the unity of the civilisation.
