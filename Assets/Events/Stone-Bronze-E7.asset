  mIntroMessage: Your civilisation advances from simple survival to organised living.
    Basic tools evolve into metalwork, villages become early settlements, and tradition
    guides every decision. Leaders emerge, food security improves, and small rituals
    honour ancestors. Yet scarcity, conflict, and limited knowledge keep progress
    fragile, shaping the foundations of everything your people will later build.
  mActionMessage: FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT - Tension rises with a neighbouring
    tribe, whether through disputed hunts, territory encroachment, or misunderstood
    signals.
  mOptionMessages:
  - Send a small peace-bearing delegation carrying symbolic gifts.
  - Prepare a ceremonial hunt to demonstrate strength without hostility.
  - Have shamans mediate through shared spiritual rites with rival shamans.
  - Strengthen border patrols to discourage encroachment.
  - Invite the rival tribe to a shared competition of skill and endurance.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The neighbouring tribe accepts the offerings graciously. Shared meals and exchanged
    stories cool tempers, laying the groundwork for future cooperation.
  - The gifts are misinterpreted as bribes or signs of weakness. The neighbouring
    tribe grows more aggressive, emboldened by what they perceive as submission.
  - Your hunters display mastery and discipline, impressing the neighbouring tribe.
    Respect replaces tension, and both sides agree to avoid future disputes.
  - The display backfires as rival hunters interpret it as a challenge. Clashes break
    out at the territory edge, fueling anger and escalating conflict.
  - The shamans enter a trance-like communion, emerging with signs interpreted as
    mutual favour. Spiritual harmony spreads, easing tensions between tribes.
  - The rival tribe accuses your shamans of manipulation. Spiritual distrust hardens
    positions, making negotiation far more difficult in the future.
  - "The patrols operate with discipline, avoiding provocation while clearly protecting
    your land. The rival tribe backs off, respecting your tribe\u2019s vigilance."
  - A misinterpreted gesture or accidental encounter sparks violence along the border.
    The neighbouring tribe mobilises, transforming the tension into open threat.
  - The competition becomes a celebration of strength rather than hostility. Laughter
    breaks through rivalry as participants recognise shared values of courage and
    honour.
  - The contests turn aggressive as tempers flare. Accusations of cheating spread
    rapidly, deepening resentment and worsening relations.
