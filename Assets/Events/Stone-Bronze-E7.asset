  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: A neighbouring tribe had begun enroaching on <CityName>'s hunting
    grounds, threatening the city's food supply.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Send a small peace-bearing delegation carrying symbolic gifts. <CityName>
  - Prepare a ceremonial hunt to demonstrate strength without hostility. <CityName>
  - Have shamans mediate through shared spiritual rites with rival shamans. <CityName>
  - Strengthen border patrols to discourage encroachment. <CityName>
  - Invite the rival tribe to a shared competition of skill and endurance. <CityName>
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The neighbouring tribe accepts the offerings graciously. Shared meals and exchanged
    stories cool tempers, laying the groundwork for future cooperation.
  - The gifts are misinterpreted as bribes or signs of weakness. The neighbouring
    tribe grows more aggressive, emboldened by what they perceive as submission.
  - Your hunters display mastery and discipline, impressing the neighbouring tribe.
    Respect replaces tension, and both sides agree to avoid future disputes.
  - The display backfires as rival hunters interpret it as a challenge. Clashes break
    out at the territory edge, fueling anger and escalating conflict.
  - The shamans enter a trance-like communion, emerging with signs interpreted as
    mutual favour. Spiritual harmony spreads, easing tensions between tribes.
  - The rival tribe accuses your shamans of manipulation. Spiritual distrust hardens
    positions, making negotiation far more difficult in the future.
  - "The patrols operate with discipline, avoiding provocation while clearly protecting
    your land. The rival tribe backs off, respecting your tribe\u2019s vigilance."
  - A misinterpreted gesture or accidental encounter sparks violence along the border.
    The neighbouring tribe mobilises, transforming the tension into open threat.
  - The competition becomes a celebration of strength rather than hostility. Laughter
    breaks through rivalry as participants recognise shared values of courage and
    honour.
  - The contests turn aggressive as tempers flare. Accusations of cheating spread
    rapidly, deepening resentment and worsening relations.
