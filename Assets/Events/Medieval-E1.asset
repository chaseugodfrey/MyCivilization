  mIntroMessage: <CityName> enters an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shapes governance, merchants connect distant routes,
    and scholars preserve knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threaten
    stability. Survival depends on how <CityName> navigates obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: "RESOURCE SHORTAGE \u2014 A failed harvest, disrupted caravan,
    or mismanaged storehouse has led to widespread scarcity. Grain prices rise, villages
    stir with unease, and whispers of misrule test the kingdom's stability."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Send knights and stewards to inspect granaries for mismanagement or hoarding.
  - Request emergency grain shipments from neighbouring kingdoms through noble diplomacy.
  - Establish temporary communal fields worked by peasants under state support.
  - Redirect castle artisans and blacksmiths to repair damaged mills and farming
    tools.
  - Hold a religious ceremony asking divine blessing for renewal and abundance.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The inspection uncovers hidden stockpiles illegally held by corrupt local officials.
    Their seizure restores fairness, and villagers celebrate the kingdom\u2019s vigilance.
    Order returns as supplies are redistributed."
  - Knights overstep their authority, seizing goods from innocent farmers. Panic
    spreads as rumours of tyranny circulate, and several villages refuse to cooperate
    with royal officers.
  - "Allied lords agree to send grain as goodwill payments, strengthening regional
    alliances. The gesture eases famine fears and elevates your realm\u2019s reputation
    as honourable and worthy of support."
  - "Foreign rulers demand steep concessions\u2014land, marriages, or trade privileges.
    Returning envoys bring little grain and heavy political costs, sowing resentment
    among your own nobility."
  - Communal farming boosts output quickly as villagers share labor and tools. The
    cooperative spirit renews trust in the crown, and harvests slowly stabilise throughout
    the region.
  - Peasants resent the forced labour and accuse overseers of favouring certain villages.
    Fights break out between communities, and productivity plummets under growing
    hostility.
  - Restored mills and freshly forged tools revitalise the countryside. Harvests
    grow more efficient, and villagers speak proudly of a ruler who cares for their
    livelihood.
  - "The craftsmen delay essential castle repairs to focus on farms. A later storm
    weakens the castle\u2019s defences, sparking outrage from nobles who accuse the
    ruler of neglecting honour and protection."
  - Priests unite the people in prayer, easing fear and strengthening communal resolve.
    Many interpret a following rainfall as a miraculous sign, restoring hope and
    loyalty to the crown.
  - The ceremony draws crowds that spread illness, and no improvement in weather
    follows. Villagers question both the clergy and the throne, deepening despair
    and mistrust.
