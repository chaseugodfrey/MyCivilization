  mIntroMessage: "FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT \u2014 A border skirmish, intercepted
    messenger, or insulted ambassador threatens peace with a neighbouring realm."
  mActionMessage: "FOREIGN RELATIONS INCIDENT \u2014 A border skirmish, intercepted
    messenger, or insulted ambassador threatens peace with a neighbouring realm."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Send envoys with gifts to reaffirm peaceful intentions.
  - Hold a tournament inviting foreign knights to compete.
  - Increase patrols and fortify frontier towers to deter aggression.
  - Arrange a marriage alliance between noble houses of both realms.
  - Invite foreign dignitaries to a feast celebrating unity between nations.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The envoys succeed in soothing tensions. Rival rulers acknowledge the goodwill
    gesture, and diplomatic channels reopen with renewed trust.
  - The gifts are dismissed as an attempt to buy favour. The rival kingdom grows
    more suspicious, tightening its military presence along the border.
  - The tournament fosters camaraderie and mutual respect. Knights bond over shared
    honour, reducing hostility between realms.
  - A jousting accident involving a foreign knight sparks outrage. Hostility rises
    as accusations of sabotage circulate.
  - The strengthened defences discourage rash actions. Citizens near the border feel
    protected, buying time for diplomats to negotiate.
  - "A patrol misunderstands a foreign caravan\u2019s actions and attacks prematurely.
    The skirmish escalates tensions dangerously."
  - The alliance builds a strong bond between courts. Peace becomes mutually beneficial
    and widely supported.
  - "Jealous nobles oppose the arrangement and begin scheming. The internal unrest
    weakens the kingdom\u2019s diplomatic position."
  - The feast impresses visiting nobles with hospitality, culture, and honour. Agreements
    are reached over shared meals and goodwill.
  - A misinterpreted jest or breach of etiquette causes offense. The visiting nobles
    return home insulted, worsening relations.
