  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: A scandal on Earth, a coup attempt on Mars, or an AI-governor malfunction
    shakes the stability of interstellar governance. Citizens across worlds question
    who truly leads humanity.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Broadcast a unified interplanetary address clarifying leadership and responsibility.
  - Form a temporary coalition government including representatives from all major
    colonies.
  - Appoint a respected AI mediator to oversee interplanetary negotiations.
  - Launch a transparent investigation into the crisis with full public access.
  - Stabilise planetary security forces and temporarily centralise authority.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The speech resonates across colonies, restoring calm. Citizens appreciate clarity
    and renewed stability in government.
  - The address is criticized as evasive or performative. Colonists react negatively,
    deepening mistrust toward leadership.
  - Shared leadership eases political tensions. Colonies feel genuinely included,
    stabilising the governance structure.
  - Ideological clashes paralyse decision-making. The coalition quickly fractures,
    worsening the crisis.
  - "The AI\u2019s neutrality restores trust and accelerates problem-solving. Citizens
    across worlds feel reassured by fair arbitration."
  - Opponents accuse the government of ceding control to machines. Protests rise
    across colonies rejecting algorithmic authority.
  - Transparency strengthens democracy. Citizens rally behind the commitment to truth,
    smoothing tensions across planets.
  - The investigation reveals uncomfortable truths, sparking fear and anger. Stability
    worsens as political factions seize the narrative.
  - Centralised command prevents unrest from spreading. Colonies appreciate the firm
    but controlled approach to restoring order.
  - Colonists fear authoritarian overreach. Security deployments trigger resistance
    movements demanding autonomy.
