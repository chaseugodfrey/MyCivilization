  mIntroMessage: Humanity expands beyond Earth into orbital stations, lunar cities,
    and early colonies. Advanced reactors, terraforming, and faster-than-light travel
    open new frontiers, but resource strain and political fragmentation grow across
    planets. Each settlement faces unique risks, and decisions now carry consequences
    stretching far beyond a single world or generation.
  mActionMessage: "DISEASE OUTBREAK \u2014 A mutated alien microbe or synthetic pathogen
    escapes containment, threatening multiple worlds."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Seal infected worlds with orbital quarantine rings.
  - "Deploy AI\u2011guided nanomedicine teams to outbreak zones."
  - "Request volunteers for experimental gene\u2011therapy trials."
  - "Broadcast system\u2011wide health protocols using immersive VR training."
  - Establish a temporary unified health authority across all colonies.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The rings halt interplanetary transmission. Doctors gain crucial time to develop
    treatments, saving millions.
  - Quarantined colonies revolt violently, demanding freedom. Riots spread as panic
    overtakes order.
  - Nanobots neutralise the pathogen with precision. The breakthrough becomes a landmark
    in medical history.
  - Nanobots malfunction under alien biochemistry. Unexpected mutations worsen the
    outbreak dramatically.
  - Trials succeed, creating resilient immune responses. Hope resurges across colonies
    as infection rates fall.
  - "Severe side\u2011effects spark fear. Anti\u2011science movements gain momentum,
    destabilising the healthcare response."
  - Compliance improves dramatically as citizens learn proper safety measures. Spread
    slows significantly.
  - VR misinformation circulates from fringe groups, confusing the public. Infection
    surges due to improper compliance.
  - "Centralisation streamlines treatment efforts and data\u2011sharing. Colonies
    unite under a shared mission to overcome the crisis."
  - Colonies resist central control, sparking political disputes that interfere with
    containment strategies.
