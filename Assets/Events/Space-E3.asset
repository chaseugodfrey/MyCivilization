  mIntroMessage: "ECONOMIC BOOM \u2014 Hyper-efficient automation, asteroid mining
    breakthroughs, or quantum markets trigger explosive economic growth. Wealth surges,
    but inequality across planets risks destabilising civilisation."
  mActionMessage: "ECONOMIC BOOM \u2014 Hyper-efficient automation, asteroid mining
    breakthroughs, or quantum markets trigger explosive economic growth. Wealth surges,
    but inequality across planets risks destabilising civilisation."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Expand orbital shipyards and hire multi-world labour forces.
  - Lower interplanetary trade tariffs to stimulate economic exchange.
  - Invest massively in Dyson-array solar collectors orbiting the Sun.
  - Support small-scale lunar, Martian, and orbital entrepreneurs with microgrants.
  - Promote interstellar tourism showcasing terraformed worlds and orbital cities.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Shipyard capacity skyrockets, supplying both civilian and military fleets. Employment
    thrives across planets, strengthening interstellar unity.
  - Labour disputes erupt between colonies competing for contracts. Accusations of
    unfair hiring spark waves of political backlash.
  - Trade routes flourish as goods flow freely across worlds. Markets stabilise and
    optimism spreads throughout colonies.
  - Local industries collapse under competition. Angry colonists accuse leadership
    of prioritising foreign planets over home economies.
  - The energy surplus transforms civilisation. Costs plummet, powering megastructures
    and giving colonies unprecedented prosperity.
  - Construction setbacks drain budgets. Critics label the project a financial black
    hole, fracturing political alliances.
  - Innovation blossoms across colonies as independent inventors create new markets.
    The boom feels inclusive and empowering.
  - Fraud and misuse of grants lead to scandals. Media outrage destabilises trust
    in economic leadership.
  - Tourism booms as citizens travel the stars. Revenue floods colonies and strengthens
    cultural exchange.
  - Overtourism damages fragile ecosystems. Environmentalists protest, claiming the
    boom is unsustainable.
