  mIntroMessage: Fortified cities, noble houses, and layered loyalties define this
    era. Faith influences rulers, merchants connect distant markets, and knowledge
    survives through dedicated scholars. Yet feuds, famine, and disease challenge
    stability at every turn. Power shifts through alliances and conflict, and your
    civilisation must navigate duty, honour, and survival to endure the age.
  mActionMessage: "NATURAL DISASTER \u2014 A storm, plague of locusts, sudden freeze,
    or river flood strikes the kingdom. Villages cry for aid; the realm must respond
    quickly."
  mOptionMessages:
  - Send knights and workers to reinforce levees, dams, and village walls.
  - Evacuate threatened villages to nearby monasteries for shelter.
  - Order a realm-wide prayer vigil led by influential clergy.
  - Deploy the royal army to deliver supplies and maintain order.
  - Construct emergency granaries and firebreaks to protect stored goods.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The reinforcements hold strong against the disaster, saving countless homes.
    Villagers praise the crown\u2019s swift action and renewed sense of security."
  - Crews arrive too late as the disaster breaches defences. Villagers blame poor
    planning, and resentment grows toward the nobility.
  - "Monasteries provide food, warmth, and prayer, easing fear. Grateful families
    speak highly of the crown\u2019s compassion."
  - Crowded halls spread sickness. Monks become overwhelmed, and frightened families
    accuse the crown of abandoning them to unhealthy conditions.
  - The vigil unifies the realm in shared faith. Even in hardship, citizens find
    strength through collective hope and religious comfort.
  - The gathering attracts too large a crowd. Panic spreads when structures fail
    or weather worsens, injuring many and undermining trust in the clergy.
  - Soldiers distribute food and enforce calm with discipline. Order is restored,
    and villagers feel protected and valued by the crown.
  - Poor coordination leads to misdelivered supplies. Some soldiers act harshly,
    igniting fear and complaints in already distressed communities.
  - "The kingdom\u2019s foresight pays off as reserves remain intact despite chaos.
    Citizens admire the crown\u2019s wisdom and preparation."
  - Firebreaks or granaries fail due to rushed planning. Precious supplies are lost,
    worsening famine and frustration.
