  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  mIntroMessage: 
  mActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Experiment with shaping stones into cutting tools.
  - Begin organising a shared storage of food and resources.
  - Attempt to domesticate small woodland animals.
  - Encourage carving symbols and markings to record hunts and discoveries.
  - Explore deeper into nearby forests to seek new materials.
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Your people discover that even a little pressure and friction can shape river
    stones into sharp-edged blades. The tribe becomes more efficient in preparing
    food, skinning animals, and crafting simple objects. Productivity improves noticeably
    and raising morale
  - "Inexperience leads to numerous injuries\u2014deep cuts, infections, and panic.
    Several hunters become unable to work, slowing productivity and causing fear
    of future innovations. The tribe becomes more hesitant to experiment."
  - The tribe band together to gather and preserve food in a makeshift communal cache.
    The improved organisation helps the group withstand sudden shortages and encourages
    trust among families. Stability rises.
  - Without understanding preservation, food spoils quickly, contaminating other
    supplies and causing a short-term illness outbreak. Valuable effort is wasted,
    and distrust forms over who contaminated the stockpile.
  - "After many trials, your people manage to hold small animals\u2014rodents, birds\u2014in
    simple woven cages. Their meat provides intermittent nourishment, and your tribe
    begins its first steps toward animal management."
  - Some animals escape and attract predators to your camp, leading to nighttime
    attacks and several injuries. The tribe interprets this as a sign they angered
    the spirits of the forest.
  - The markings evolve into a proto-language. Knowledge becomes easier to share
    across groups, preventing skills from being lost and strengthening identity.
    Elders praise the innovation.
  - "Arguments erupt over differing interpretations of the markings. Rival groups
    accuse each other of trying to claim hunts they didn\u2019t participate in. This
    seeds resentment within the tribe."
  - "Explorers return with new wood types, stones, and plants that enrich the tribe\u2019s
    understanding of the land. These resources enable better shelters and tools,
    improving overall prosperity."
  - A group of explorers is lost in dense terrain. Their disappearance demoralises
    the tribe, and fear of the unknown grows. The tribe withdraws inward and reducing
    ambition.
