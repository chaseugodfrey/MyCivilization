  mIntroMessage: <CityName> had strengthened into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and a growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances had expanded
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshaped its borders. Prosperity had
    risen, but so had rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balanced
    ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative
    age.
  mActionMessage: Rumours of a deadly illness circulated through the crowded districts
    of <CityName>. While only a handful had fallen ill, fear and uncertainty unsettled
    markets, gatherings, and daily routines.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:

  - sent messengers to neighbouring cities seeking medicinal herbs and knowledge.
  - ordered regular cleansing of wells, streets, and communal spaces.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The quarantines contained the illness swiftly, preventing its reach into the
    denser districts. Though difficult, the firm action saved many lives and restored
    confidence in the city\u2019s leadership."
  - The quarantines caused panic as families were separated, and supplies ran short
    within the isolated districts. Several citizens resisted confinement, leading
    to unrest and further disorder.
  - "The healers identified patterns in the illness and developed effective remedies.
    Their efforts slowed the spread dramatically, and gratitude toward <CityName>\u2019s
    healers grew throughout the city."
  - The physicians disagreed on causes and cures, offering conflicting treatments
    that worsened confusion. Distrust of the healers spread, and the illness continued
    unchecked.
  - Limiting public gatherings slowed the contagion, and daily life adapted gradually.
    Citizens acknowledged the necessity, and the city regained a sense of cautious
    stability.
  - Merchants, performers, and citizens protested the restrictions, claiming livelihoods
    and rituals were being destroyed. Compliance faltered, and the illness spread
    more rapidly through secret gatherings.
  - The messengers returned with rare herbs and valuable medical scrolls. The new
    remedies eased symptoms, and neighbouring cities praised <CityName> for its humility
    and cooperation.
  - "Several cities refused assistance, fearing contamination. The messengers returned
    empty-handed, and rumours of rejection deepened the city\u2019s sense of isolation."
  - The cleansing efforts improved hygiene across <CityName>, and infections declined
    noticeably. Citizens felt reassured by the visible action and embraced cleaner
    habits thereafter.
  - "Despite the cleansing, the illness persisted, and some accused officials of
    performing empty gestures. Mismanagement scandals emerged, fueling anger toward
    the city\u2019s administration."
