  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: "A sudden abundance of valuable resources uplifted <CityName>,
    opening doors to prosperity and shared opportunity. Yet with newfound wealth
    came choices about stewardship, equality, and how the bounty should shape the
    city\u2019s future."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - hosted a Festival of Plenty to share the abundance across all clans of <CityName>.
  - asked the village smith to craft tools, ornaments, and trade goods from the surplus
    resources.
  - established a trading circle with neighbouring tribes to exchange goods and strengthen
    relations.
  - "stored the excess safely in clay-lined pits and smokehouses to secure <CityName>\u2019s
    future needs."
  - sent a band of settlers carrying surplus supplies to explore and claim promising
    new lands.

  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The tribe feasted joyfully beneath torchlit skies, exchanging goods and stories
    that warmed old rivalries. The celebration transformed prosperity into unity,
    leaving the clans hopeful for the future of <CityName>.
  - The festival grew excessive, and accusations soon arose that some clans had contributed
    less or taken more. What should have united <CityName> instead stirred envy and
    bitterness.
  - "Stonecutters and carvers fashioned works of beauty and precision. Their craftsmanship
    elevated <CityName>\u2019s identity and inspired pride across all clans."
  - Craftsmen wasted rare resources chasing unproven designs, sparking disputes over
    ownership of the items. What began as creative ambition soon felt like mismanagement.
  - Trade brought new dyes, hides, tools, and stories into <CityName>. This strengthened
    the <CityName>'s reputation as it became a valued partner in regional exchanges.
  - "Rival tribes exploited <CityName>\u2019s boom, demanding unfair trades and threatening
    raids. The blessing of abundance quickly turned into a political burden."
  - The new storage pits preserved food through difficult seasons, granting <CityName>
    long-term security. For the first time, the people imagined a stable and reliable
    future.
  - Structural failures destroyed a large portion of the preserved resources. Shock
    and finger-pointing spread as clans questioned the judgement behind the storage
    plan.
  - "Explorers returned with tales of fertile valleys, rivers teeming with life,
    and rich stone deposits. Their discoveries broadened the tribe\u2019s hope for
    expansion in the future."
  - "The distant lands proved treacherous, and many settlers never returned. These
    losses shook the tribe\u2019s confidence and cast a long shadow over thoughts
    on future expansion."
