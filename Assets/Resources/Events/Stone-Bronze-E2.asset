  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: Disagreements between clans over traditions, rituals, and ancestral
    customs threatened to fracture the unity of <CityName>.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - 'held a Great Fire Gathering where all the clans of <CityName> voiced their beliefs. '
  - "asked the shamans to conduct a spirit\u2011walk, seeking guidance from the all-fathers
    of <CityName>."
  - permitted each clan to freely embrace its customs without interference.
  - conducted a symbolic hunt requiring warriors from all clans to cooperate, in
    an effort to re-unite the clans.
  - "gave the youth of the different clans to form a cross\u2011clan learning circle."
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - At the Great Fire Gathering, each clan shares its stories and sacred songs. Differences
    soften as the tribe recognises the shared roots beneath their customs. Warmth
    replaces tension.
  - "The gathering erupts into shouting as long\u2011held grudges surface. Clans
    storm away from the fire, and the unity meant to be restored fractures even deeper."
  - The shamans return with visions of clan totems walking side by side. Their message
    of harmony reassures the people, restoring faith that the ancestors favour unity
    over discord.
  - The shamans deliver conflicting visions, each claiming a different clan is favoured.
    Suspicion spreads rapidly, and spiritual uncertainty deepens the divide.
  - Allowed to express their identity openly, clans celebrate their songs, carvings,
    and rites. Curiosity replaces jealousy as traditions flourish peacefully in parallel.
  - The clans drift further apart, their symbols and customs becoming walls rather
    than bridges. Soon, families refuse to share hunts or communal meals.
  - The unified hunting band triumphs, returning with abundant game. The shared victory
    becomes a legend retold around fires, renewing trust among rival clans.
  - "The hunt ends in chaos as miscommunication causes injury and lost prey. The
    failure becomes a symbol of the tribe\u2019s fractured spirit."
  - "Young hunters and gatherers learn each other\u2019s skills, forming friendships
    that cut across clan boundaries. Their unity inspires cautious optimism among
    the elders."
  - Elders interpret the circle as a threat to tradition and forbid participation.
    The youth grow resentful, widening the generational rift.
