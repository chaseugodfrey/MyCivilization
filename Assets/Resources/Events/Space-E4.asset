  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: "A breakthrough in quantum-guided bioengineering promised to rewrite
    humanity\u2019s limits, offering immunity to radiation, low-gravity adaptation,
    and century-long vitality. But its potential reshaped debates about what it meant
    to remain human."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - approved controlled trials of the bioengineering breakthrough under strict scientific
    oversight.
  - restricted its use to medical necessity while banning enhancements deemed purely
    cosmetic or excessive.
  - invited philosophers, scientists, and synthetic intelligences to debate new definitions
    of humanity.
  - distributed the breakthrough to frontier colonies most vulnerable to radiation
    and low gravity.
  - placed a temporary moratorium on further modifications until long-term effects
    were understood.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The trials proved safe and effective. Enhanced resilience spread through key
    sectors of <CityName>, and public trust grew in the careful approach to human
    advancement.
  - Unexpected mutations appeared in early test groups. Panic spread, and critics
    condemned <CityName> for allowing experimentation before understanding the risks.
  - The limitations reassured anxious citizens, preventing reckless overuse. The
    breakthrough saved countless lives without destabilising the cultural balance
    of <CityName>.
  - "Black-market demand exploded. Illegal enhancement clinics emerged across several
    worlds, deepening inequality and undermining <CityName>\u2019s control."
  - The symposium forged a visionary consensus on identity and personhood. This new
    ethical charter unified divergent populations and guided future research with
    clarity.
  - The debate spiralled into ideological conflict. Uplifted citizens, baseline humans,
    and synthetics could not agree on shared principles, widening the fracture over
    what humanity meant.
  - The colonies flourished as newly adapted settlers overcame environmental hazards.
    Prosperity spread outward, and <CityName> earned praise for its strategic compassion.
  - "Some colonies used their enhanced abilities to claim greater autonomy. Their
    demands for independence surged, threatening <CityName>\u2019s hold over frontier
    regions."
  - "The moratorium strengthened confidence in <CityName>\u2019s caution. Citizens
    valued the restraint, and research teams gained time to ensure the breakthrough
    posed no hidden dangers."
  - Corporations and radical enhancement groups condemned the delay. Several factions
    pursued unauthorized research in secret, risking unpredictable consequences for
    the entire civilisation.
