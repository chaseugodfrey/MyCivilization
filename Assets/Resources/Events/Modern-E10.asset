  mIntroMessage: Industrial change reshaped <CityName> with new technologies, expanding
    factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenged old systems,
    while global trade raised both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerated faster
    than society adapted, and <CityName> had to balance progress with stability as
    it confronted competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.
  mActionMessage: Unsanitary factory quarters and crowded worker housing fostered
    the spread of illness in <CityName>. Though contained at first, the rising concern
    threatened to disrupt production and daily life.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - expanded infirmaries and hired additional medical staff.
  - implemented mandatory sanitation inspections in factories and dormitories.
  - ordered temporary closures of infected workshops.
  - distributed free medicinal tonics to workers and families.
  - relocated the sick to quarantine wards outside the industrial core.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The expanded infirmaries treated the sick efficiently, reducing fatalities and
    preventing the illness from overwhelming the city. Citizens praised the swift
    and compassionate response.
  - Despite the expansion, the influx of patients exceeded capacity. Medical staff
    were overworked, supplies dwindled, and frustration rose across the industrial
    districts.
  - The inspections uncovered critical issues, leading to rapid improvements in hygiene.
    The spread of illness slowed, and workers felt safer returning to their stations.
  - "Several factories resisted the inspections, hiding violations or bribing inspectors.
    Outbreak clusters worsened, and public trust in the city\u2019s oversight eroded."
  - The closures halted transmission chains and gave health workers time to contain
    the outbreak. Production slowed but the city's overall wellbeing improved.
  - The shutdowns caused major financial losses, and many workers lost wages. Anger
    toward factory owners and city officials mounted as hardships deepened.
  - "The tonics eased symptoms and supported recovery, restoring hope among the affected
    districts. The gesture strengthened morale and demonstrated <CityName>\u2019s
    care for its citizens."
  - The tonics proved ineffective for many, and rumours spread that they were diluted
    or experimental. Distrust grew, and some citizens refused further treatment.
  - The quarantines contained the outbreak and reduced pressure on city hospitals.
    Healthy districts stabilised, and the city regained control of the crisis.
  - Conditions in the wards were harsh, and families protested the forced separations.
    Several outbreaks emerged within the wards themselves, sparking accusations of
    neglect.
