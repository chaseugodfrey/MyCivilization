  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The hearing demonstrates accountability and transparency. Citizens feel empowered
    by open justice and trust begins to rebuild.
  - The hearing becomes politicised, with grandstanding overshadowing substance.
    Public frustration intensifies as real answers fail to emerge.
  - The decision signals compassion and modern values. Social groups praise the forward-thinking
    approach to justice and societal healing.
  - Opponents accuse you of being soft on crime. The decision triggers heated public
    debate, with some claiming the justice system is losing its authority. Tensions
    rise as confidence in legal institutions erodes.
  - The firm ruling reassures those who fear chaos and lawlessness. Supporters applaud
    the clarity and strength of the legal system.
  - Human rights groups and reform advocates condemn the severity. Protests grow,
    and the nation wrestles with accusations of injustice.
  - "The committee\u2019s thorough investigation and recommendations lend credibility
    to the final decision. Citizens see a balanced approach to justice and ethics."
  - The committee takes too long or appears biased. Many dismiss its findings, and
    the attempt at neutrality is mocked as indecision.
  - Structured conversations help citizens air concerns constructively. New perspectives
    spread, and the issue becomes a catalyst for civic education.
  - Discussions spiral into toxic arguments despite moderation. Echo chambers deepen,
    and the controversy leaves society more divided than before.
