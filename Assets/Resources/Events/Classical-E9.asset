  mIntroMessage: <CityName> strengthens into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances expand
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshape its borders. Prosperity rises,
    but so do rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balances ambition
    and stability determines its path through this transformative age.
  mActionMessage: "DISEASE OUTBREAK \u2014 Illness sweeps through crowded cities
    and trade ports. The state must act quickly to contain panic and loss."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Variable
  mOptionMessages:
  - Build quarantine wards outside the city walls.
  - Consult herbalists, healers, and foreign physicians for remedies.
  - Close major markets and ports temporarily to slow transmission.
  - Organise communal prayer gatherings and rites for health.
  - "Dispatch scholars to research the disease\u2019s patterns and causes."
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Physicians coordinate treatments in safe, isolated wards. Though harsh, the containment
    slows the spread and reassures citizens that the state is acting decisively.
  - Quarantine wards overflow and become poorly supplied. Families protest separation,
    and fear spreads faster than the disease itself.
  - Knowledge from distant lands combines with local practices, creating effective
    treatments. Recovery rates rise, and trade networks admire your civilisation's
    adaptability.
  - Foreign remedies clash with traditional beliefs. Accusations of poisoning and
    sabotage spread, causing civil unrest and stalling treatment efforts.
  - "Though economically painful, the closures drastically slow the spread. Citizens
    commend the government\u2019s willingness to protect lives over wealth."
  - Markets collapse under the strain of closures. Merchants rebel, demanding compensation,
    and the economy plunges into chaos.
  - Temples teach calm and discipline, easing panic. Citizens find emotional strength
    in unity, improving resilience against fear-driven disorder.
  - Crowded rites accelerate disease transmission. Public ire erupts at priests for
    endangering lives, damaging religious authority.
  - Scholarly investigation uncovers patterns in symptoms and spread. Their insights
    allow for targeted interventions that save countless lives.
  - Scholars disagree publicly, presenting contradictory theories. Confusion spreads
    across the population, weakening trust in both science and leadership.
