  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extends its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel open
    new frontiers, but resources stretch thin and political interests diverge across
    worlds. Each decision carries amplified consequences, shaping whether <CityName>
    thrives among the stars or fractures under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: "INTERNAL CONFLICT \u2014 Rising tensions between genetically\u2011modified
    populations, baseline humans, AI citizens, and off\u2011world colonists ignite
    civil unrest."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Variable
  mOptionMessages:
  - "Host interspecies and inter\u2011colony reconciliation summits."
  - "Deploy non\u2011lethal peacekeeper drones to stabilise protests."
  - "Introduce anti\u2011discrimination laws across all colonies."
  - "Invest in shared cultural and scientific institutions off\u2011world."
  - Temporarily restrict interplanetary travel to slow hostilities.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The summits foster empathy and reveal shared hopes. Peaceful cooperation reemerges
    across planets.
  - Radical groups disrupt the meetings, spreading fear and propaganda. Trust between
    communities collapses.
  - Drones disperse crowds safely and efficiently. Citizens commend the restraint
    shown in maintaining order.
  - A drone malfunction injures civilians, amplifying outrage. Protests intensify
    across colonies.
  - The laws improve social harmony as marginalised populations feel protected and
    respected by central governance.
  - Some colonies reject the laws as overreach. Movements for planetary autonomy
    grow stronger.
  - Joint institutions flourish, offering education and innovation to all species
    and populations. Collaboration deepens.
  - Funding disputes erupt between colonies, framing the institutions as politically
    biased. Resentment spreads.
  - Travel limits contain tensions and prevent violent outbreaks. Order gradually
    returns.
  - The restrictions cripple commerce and isolate families. Economic and emotional
    strain ignite new conflicts.
