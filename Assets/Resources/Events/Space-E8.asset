  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: A dormant alien microbe unearthed from an exoplanet excavation
    awakened unexpectedly, spreading through bio-interfaces and threatening to destabilise
    ecosystems and cybernetic systems across <CityName>.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - sealed all exoplanetary research labs and enforced a sector-wide biological quarantine.
  - summoned xenobiologists and cybernetic engineers to design counter-agents targeting
    both organic and digital infection paths.
  - purged compromised habitats using controlled atmosphere-cycling protocols.
  - activated bio-containment drones to isolate and neutralise contaminated zones.
  - requested emergency assistance from interstellar health authorities experienced
    with xeno-pathogens.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The quarantine halted cross-system contamination and contained the microbe within
    controlled zones. Researchers gained time to study its behaviour, preventing
    a far wider catastrophe.
  - "The quarantine arrived too late\u2014undetected carriers had already spread
    the microbe off-world. Entire districts entered lockdown, and trade networks
    collapsed under the restrictions."
  - The joint taskforce developed a hybrid antiviral-firewall agent that neutralised
    the microbe in both biological hosts and cybernetic systems. Recovery began swiftly
    across <CityName>.
  - The specialists clashed over methodology, delaying progress. The microbe mutated
    faster than anticipated, infecting new interfaces and overwhelming existing defences.
  - "The cycling sterilised affected domes and stations with impressive efficiency.
    Once declared safe, habitats reopened with renewed confidence in <CityName>\u2019s
    emergency systems."
  - The cycling damaged critical life support systems and destabilised habitat climates.
    Several zones became uninhabitable for weeks, creating displacement and political
    backlash.
  - The drones acted swiftly, sealing off infected areas and deploying targeted sterilisation
    bursts. Their intervention slowed the spread dramatically and prevented mass
    casualties.
  - The microbe infiltrated drone firmware, causing units to malfunction or disobey
    commands. Rogue drones spread contamination further, escalating the crisis.
  - The authorities responded quickly, sending specialised teams and advanced countermeasures.
    Their expertise reduced the outbreak to manageable levels and prevented ecosystem
    collapse.
  - The request was delayed by bureaucratic gridlock, and help arrived too late.
    The outbreak spiralled, and citizens accused <CityName> of relying too heavily
    on outside intervention.
