  mIntroMessage: Industrial change reshapes <CityName> with new technologies, expanding
    factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenge old systems,
    while global trade raises both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerates faster
    than society adapts, and <CityName> must balance progress with stability as it
    confronts competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.
  mActionMessage: "INTERNAL CONFLICT \u2014 Political extremists, activist groups,
    or rival factions clash within the nation. Civil unrest threatens stability unless
    decisive action is taken."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:

  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The referendum restores faith in the democratic process. Citizens appreciate
    being heard, and tensions ease as dialogue replaces confrontation.
  - Results deepen division as factions reject the outcome. Accusations of fraud
    spread online, worsening unrest and destabilising cities.
  - Peacekeepers disperse protests with minimal force, protecting lives and calming
    tensions. Their restraint earns public respect.
  - Clashes erupt when a small group of officers misjudge the situation. Viral footage
    sparks outrage, intensifying the conflict.
  - Reform talks progress slowly but steadily. Citizens appreciate the inclusive
    approach, and violence subsides as compromises emerge.
  - Talks collapse when extremists refuse participation. Critics dismiss the commission
    as political theatre, fuelling resentment.
  - New opportunities reduce desperation and anger. Communities respond positively
    as jobs, education, and stability return.
  - Funds are mismanaged, leading to scandals. Opponents accuse the government of
    buying loyalty, worsening political polarization.
  - The debates humanise rival leaders and reduce misinformation. Citizens begin
    to see peaceful negotiation as possible again.
  - Debates devolve into insults and propaganda. Public perception worsens, reinforcing
    stereotypes and fuelling hostility.
