  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: "As humanity spread across the star systems of <CityName>, cultures
    diverged at light-year distances. Planet-born settlers, orbital megastructure
    dwellers, AI-guided societies, and gene-augmented lineages clashed over identity
    and the right to define civilisation\u2019s future."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - convened an interstellar congress where representatives from every lineage and
    habitat debated shared cultural principles.
  - authorised cultural autonomy charters, allowing each world and society to govern
    its identity without central interference.
  - deployed cultural mediators for humans and AI alike to ease tensions between
    divergent communities across the star systems.
  - commissioned a unified historical archive to preserve the origins of all cultures
    and strengthen a shared civilisational narrative.
  - "expanded long-range communication networks to reduce isolation and reconnect
    distant colonies with <CityName>\u2019s core values."
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The congress fostered unexpected alliances. Delegates forged a charter of mutual
    respect that eased rising tensions, and <CityName> entered a new era of cooperative
    identity-building.
  - "The congress descended into ideological chaos as factions clashed over incompatible
    beliefs. Several delegations withdrew in protest, intensifying division across
    <CityName>\u2019s systems."
  - Autonomy brought peace. Worlds flourished under self-defined cultures, and loyalty
    to <CityName> strengthened as citizens felt respected and unthreatened by central
    authority.
  - "The charters encouraged fragmentation. Some colonies drifted dangerously close
    to secession, weakening <CityName>\u2019s influence and fracturing civilisational
    unity."
  - "The mediators defused heated disputes with remarkable neutrality. Conflicts
    cooled across thousands of light-years, and their success restored confidence
    in <CityName>\u2019s leadership."
  - Several communities rejected the mediators as biased or intrusive. In some sectors,
    tensions escalated, and the presence of outside influence only inflamed hostility.
  - The archive inspired pride across <CityName>. Citizens rediscovered their interconnected
    past, and shared stories rekindled a sense of belonging across diverse populations.
  - The archive sparked outrage as some groups felt misrepresented or diminished.
    Disputes over historical interpretation erupted, and old grievances resurfaced
    with renewed intensity.
  - The improved networks bridged star-spanning distances. Delayed communication
    collapsed to minutes, revitalising cultural exchange and restoring unity across
    scattered systems.
  - The expanded networks exposed ideological conflict in real time. Misunderstandings
    travelled faster than diplomacy, amplifying disputes and accelerating civilisational
    fragmentation.
