  mIntroMessage: Industrial change reshaped <CityName> with new technologies, expanding
    factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenged old systems,
    while global trade raised both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerated faster
    than society adapted, and <CityName> had to balance progress with stability as
    it confronted competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.
  mActionMessage: "A catastrophic failure at <CityName>\u2019s chemical refining
    plant released toxic gas across several districts. The fumes sickened workers
    and families alike, disrupting daily life and raising urgent concerns about the
    safety of the city\u2019s industrial expansion."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - ordered an immediate evacuation of all affected districts to safeguard citizens
    from further exposure.
  - sent engineers and medical teams to contain the leak, neutralise the gas, and
    aid the injured.
  - halted operations at all chemical plants pending a full safety inspection.
  - set up emergency clinics and distributed protective gear to stabilise the population.
  - commissioned an independent inquiry to determine the cause of the failure and
    assign accountability.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The evacuation saved countless lives, clearing the districts before the fumes
    intensified. Families reached safety, and gratitude grew toward <CityName>\u2019s
    swift response."
  - The sudden evacuation caused chaos and trampling in narrow streets. Some families
    became separated, and several evacuees suffered injuries or exposure during the
    disorder.
  - The response teams worked with precision, sealing the breach and treating the
    affected. Their bravery restored confidence, and the crisis subsided far sooner
    than feared.
  - The teams underestimated the severity of the leak. Several responders collapsed,
    efforts stalled, and the fumes spread farther before containment could resume.
  - The shutdown prevented further accidents and allowed inspectors to uncover critical
    faults. Citizens felt reassured knowing <CityName> was prioritising safety over
    profit.
  - The shutdown triggered severe economic slowdown. Factories idled, wages fell,
    and merchants protested the sweeping closures, deepening public frustration.
  - The clinics treated the sick efficiently, and protective gear limited further
    poisoning. The swift medical response kept fatalities low and stabilised the
    districts.
  - Supplies ran short, and clinics overflowed. Protective gear proved insufficient,
    and many accused the city of distributing faulty equipment, inflaming public
    anger.
  - The inquiry uncovered negligence, leading to major safety reforms and renewed
    trust in city leadership. Citizens praised the commitment to transparency.
  - The investigation dragged on with no clear results. Rumours of bribery and hidden
    evidence spread, causing distrust and widening the rift between workers and industrial
    leaders.
