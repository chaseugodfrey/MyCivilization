  mIntroMessage: Industrial change reshapes <CityName> with new technologies, expanding
    factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenge old systems,
    while global trade raises both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerates faster
    than society adapts, and <CityName> must balance progress with stability as it
    confronts competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.
  mActionMessage: "TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH \u2014 A revolutionary discovery in
    AI, biotechnology, quantum computing, energy, or engineering emerges. The world
    watches to see how it will be used."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Variable
  mOptionMessages:
  - Publish the breakthrough openly to accelerate global scientific collaboration.

  - License the technology to major corporations for rapid industrialisation.
  - Apply the breakthrough to national defence initiatives.
  - Build a civilian innovation hub to encourage startups and independent inventors.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - International labs build upon the discovery rapidly. Your nation becomes synonymous
    with scientific leadership, and global goodwill increases.
  - Rival nations weaponise or exploit the information first. Critics claim your
    openness risked national security and economic dominance.
  - The process becomes a model for safe innovation. Citizens feel protected from
    reckless experimentation, and global organisations praise your transparency.
  - Regulatory delays frustrate scientists and investors. The breakthrough loses
    momentum, and competing nations surpass your progress.
  - Corporations deploy the technology at scale, boosting productivity and creating
    new markets. Employment rises and the economy accelerates dramatically.
  - Corporate monopolies emerge, exploiting workers and consumers. Scandals erupt
    over unethical use, damaging both national image and public trust.
  - Military capabilities leap forward, deterring foreign threats. Citizens feel
    safe knowing the nation is protected by cutting-edge technology.
  - Global tensions spike as neighbouring nations accuse you of escalating an arms
    race. Sanctions and diplomatic pressure increase.
  - Entrepreneurs flock to the hub, creating a hotspot of creativity and invention.
    New industries blossom from unexpected places, diversifying the economy.
  - The hub becomes a money sink with little output. Mismanagement and fraud lead
    to scandal, discrediting the initiative.
