  mIntroMessage: <CityName> entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes,
    and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened
    stability. Survival depended on how <CityName> navigated obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: A mismanaged granary left <CityName> short of grain as winter approached.
    Prices soared, villagers murmured of incompetence or corruption, and unrest simmered
    at the edges of the realm.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - sent knights and stewards to inspect granaries for hoarding.
  - requested emergency grain shipments from neighbouring kingdoms through noble
    diplomacy.
  - established temporary communal fields worked by peasants under state support.
  - redirected castle artisans and blacksmiths to repair damaged mills and farming
    tools.
  - held a religious ceremony asking divine blessing for renewal and abundance.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The inspections uncovered hidden stores and corrupt handlers. The recovered grain
    stabilised prices, and the people praised <CityName> for swiftly restoring fairness.
  - The inspections angered several powerful households accused of wrongdoing. Tensions
    rose, and accusations of overreach deepened mistrust between the council and
    the nobility.
  - The neighbouring realm answered with generosity, sending wagons of grain before
    the frost set in. Their aid carried <CityName> through winter and strengthened
    diplomatic ties.
  - "The neighbours refused, demanding heavy tribute in exchange. The failed diplomacy
    embarrassed <CityName>, and rumours spread that the council had weakened the
    kingdom\u2019s standing."
  - The communal fields produced a modest but vital harvest. Peasants felt valued,
    cooperation flourished, and <CityName> weathered the shortage with resilience.
  - The initiative overburdened already exhausted peasants. Many fields yielded too
    little, tempers flared, and resentment grew toward the council for forcing extra
    labour in desperate times.
  - The repaired mills ran smoothly again, restoring steady grain production. Villages
    welcomed the renewed efficiency, and hope returned to <CityName> as winter approached.
  - "The repairs came too late or proved insufficient. Tools broke again, mills jammed,
    and the wasted effort frustrated both artisans and farmers, worsening the realm\u2019s
    anxiety."
  - The ceremony united the realm in prayer, lifting spirits and calming unrest.
    Soon after, several villages reported unexpected surpluses, which the people
    of <CityName> took as a sign of divine favour.
  - "The ceremony failed to soothe the anxious populace. Some mocked it as empty
    pageantry, others blamed the priests, and faith in <CityName>\u2019s leadership
    wavered as hunger loomed."
