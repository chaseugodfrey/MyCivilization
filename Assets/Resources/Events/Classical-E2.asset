    ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative
    age.
  mActionMessage: "An influx of rare goods and valuable resources reached <CityName>
    through expanded trade routes. Prosperity surged, offering opportunities for
    growth\u2014yet demanding careful stewardship to ensure wealth did not breed
    inequality."

  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The expanded marketplace thrived as merchants from distant regions filled its
    stalls. New goods, ideas, and opportunities enriched daily life in <CityName>,
    and prosperity flowed through every district.
  - The sudden influx of foreign traders overwhelmed the market. Prices fluctuated
    wildly, guilds quarreled over rights, and long-standing merchants felt pushed
    aside, stirring resentment throughout the city.
  - "The restored roads transformed commerce across <CityName>. Caravans traveled
    swiftly and safely, increasing revenue and strengthening ties with trading partners
    who praised the city\u2019s reliability."
  - Repairs proved costlier than expected, draining the surplus before the work was
    complete. Several routes remained unfinished, frustrating merchants and leaving
    <CityName> exposed to criticism for wasted resources.
  - "The merchant council managed the new wealth with surprising fairness. By regulating
    prices and shares, they ensured benefits reached every citizen, earning gratitude
    and stabilising the city\u2019s economic boom."
  - The council quickly fractured as powerful merchants sought control. Accusations
    of corruption spread, and instead of fairness, the city found itself mired in
    political infighting and economic distrust.
  - The caravans impressed neighbouring cities with their generosity. Several regions
    pledged lasting alliances, granting <CityName> protection, trade privileges,
    and new diplomatic prestige.
  - "Some neighbouring leaders viewed the gifts as attempted bribery or manipulation.
    The caravans returned with strained relations, and <CityName>\u2019s intentions
    were questioned across the region."
  - "Public works blossomed across <CityName>\u2014new fountains, plazas, and storerooms
    improved quality of life and boosted civic pride. The prosperity felt real, visible,
    and shared by all."
  - "Construction delays and mismanagement plagued the projects, consuming resources
    without delivering results. Citizens grew impatient, and many questioned whether
    the boom\u2019s benefits had already been squandered."
