  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: "A call for renewed leadership arose within <CityName>, as clans
    proposed fresh voices and new ideas for guiding the city\u2019s path. This moment
    of transition offered hope for reform, though its success depended on unity and
    wisdom."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - "organised a Clash of Clans to choose <CityName>\u2019s leader through feats
    of strength."
  - asked the shamans to read the stars and reveal whom the spirits favoured to lead
    <CityName>.
  - formed a temporary Council of Clans to lead <CityName> jointly.
  - "held a series of trials in which candidates proved their wisdom, strategy, and
    knowledge of <CityName>\u2019s needs."
  - opened the ancestral archives and required each candidate to present a vision
    for <CityName> guided by past wisdom.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The Clash of Clans concluded with a clear victor whose strength won the respect
    of every challenger. The clans accepted the result with pride, and the new leader\u2019s
    authority brought renewed stability to <CityName>."
  - The contest descended into brutal rivalries, with accusations of cheating and
    dishonour echoing through the arena. Instead of unity, the trial deepened old
    grudges and left the clans more divided than before.
  - "The shamans returned with a unanimous reading of the stars, naming a leader
    whom all clans recognized as spiritually chosen. Confidence rose across <CityName>,
    and harmony followed with the ancestors\u2019 guidance."
  - "The shamans\u2019 interpretations clashed, each claiming a different clan\u2019s
    champion was favoured by the spirits. Doubt spread quickly, and <CityName> descended
    into spiritual rivalry rather than unity."
  - The temporary Council governed with surprising cooperation. Shared decisions
    eased tensions, and clans felt genuinely represented. What began as a trial experiment
    became a symbol of collective strength for <CityName>.
  - The Council collapsed under competing agendas as clan leaders argued over every
    choice. Without clear authority, governance stalled, and frustration hardened
    into rivalry across the city.
  - The leadership trials revealed a candidate whose insight, fairness, and strategy
    impressed even distrusting clans. Their measured judgment won broad support,
    ushering in a period of thoughtful progress.
  - "The trials exposed the candidates\u2019 flaws more than their strengths. Accusations
    of bias and manipulation overshadowed the process, and the clans left feeling
    more distrustful than before the trials began."
  - The candidates presented visions rooted in ancestral wisdom, and one plan resonated
    deeply across <CityName>. Elders and youth alike found direction in the chosen
    vision, restoring faith in a shared future.
  - The archives stirred fierce debate as candidates twisted ancestral teachings
    to favour their own clans. The past, meant to guide unity, instead fueled conflict,
    leaving <CityName> uncertain of its path forward.
