  mIntroMessage: Industrial change reshaped <CityName> with new technologies, expanding
    factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenged old systems,
    while global trade raised both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerated faster
    than society adapted, and <CityName> had to balance progress with stability as
    it confronted competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.
  mActionMessage: Rapid factory growth and new trade networks brought unprecedented
    wealth to <CityName>. Jobs multiplied, markets flourished, and the city faced
    decisions on how to distribute and sustain its prosperity.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - expanded the factory districts to accommodate new workshops and industries.
  - invested surplus profits into housing projects for workers and their families.
  - established a trade council to regulate tariffs and stabilise market prices.
  - sent envoys to negotiate long-term shipping agreements with foreign ports.
  - directed funds toward modernising roads, rail lines, and warehouses.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The expansion attracted skilled workers and investors from across the region.
    Production soared, and <CityName> solidified its reputation as a rising industrial
    power.
  - The expansion outpaced planning, causing overcrowding and unsafe conditions.
    Several workshops suffered accidents, and critics argued that growth had become
    reckless.
  - The new housing eased overcrowding and improved living standards. Workers felt
    valued, productivity rose, and the city gained praise for its forward-thinking
    civic spirit.
  - Construction delays and cost overruns plagued the projects. Many buildings remained
    unfinished, and workers blamed city officials for broken promises and wasted
    funds.
  - The council balanced competing interests and kept markets steady during rapid
    growth. Merchants and consumers alike benefited from fair pricing and predictable
    trade.
  - Council members fell into disagreement and formed rival blocs, each pushing their
    own interests. Markets destabilised further, and accusations of corruption spread
    quickly.
  - The envoys secured favourable agreements, guaranteeing steady imports and exports.
    Trade flourished, and <CityName> strengthened its foothold in international commerce.
  - Talks broke down when foreign ports demanded concessions <CityName> refused to
    give. Relations cooled, and merchants feared the boom would collapse without
    stable shipping routes.
  - "The modernised infrastructure dramatically improved transport efficiency. Goods
    moved faster, profits rose, and the entire region benefited from <CityName>\u2019s
    improved network."
  - "Poor oversight led to faulty construction and wasted materials. Several key
    routes remained incomplete, and traders openly criticised the city\u2019s mismanagement."
