  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: An unforeseen chance placed <CityName> at a crossroads, forcing
    its clans to weigh compassion against caution and duty against desire. The decision
    would echo through generations, revealing the heart of the city.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - extended aid and resources to those in need, choosing generosity over caution.
  - "withheld aid to protect <CityName>\u2019s resources and ensure its own security."
  - sought guidance from elders before committing to any course of action.
  - gathered the clans to debate the opportunity openly and decide through consensus.
  - "used the opportunity to strengthen <CityName>\u2019s long-term position, even
    if it required difficult sacrifices."
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The aid reached those in need, and word of <CityName>\u2019s generosity spread
    far beyond its borders. The clans felt pride in their compassion, and new bonds
    of goodwill strengthened the city\u2019s reputation."
  - The generous outpouring strained food stores and labour, leaving <CityName> vulnerable
    during the following season. Some clans ended up questioning whether kindness
    had overshadowed prudence.
  - By withholding aid, <CityName> preserved its stores and labour, allowing the
    clans to endure an unexpectedly harsh season. Some quietly admitted that caution
    had protected the city when it needed strength most.
  - "Those turned away remembered the refusal, and word spread of <CityName>\u2019s
    coldness. Neighbouring groups withdrew trust, and even within the city some clans
    questioned what honour remained in choosing safety over compassion."
  - "The elders\u2019 counsel brought clarity. Their wisdom helped the clans craft
    a thoughtful response, and the decision was accepted peacefully across <CityName>."
  - "The elders\u2019 debate dragged on, offering no clear direction. Impatience
    grew among the clans, and by the time a choice was made, the opportunity had
    passed and trust in elder judgment faltered."
  - The clans gathered under open sky, speaking with candor and respect. Through
    careful discussion, they forged a rare consensus. The unity forged in that circle
    endured long after the decision itself.
  - The debate spiraled into arguments as rival clans pushed conflicting agendas.
    No consensus formed, and bitterness lingered, leaving <CityName> more divided
    than before the meeting.
  - "The strategic decision bore fruit in the seasons that followed. Though difficult
    at first, the sacrifices strengthened <CityName>\u2019s long-term position and
    secured its future prosperity."
  - The sacrifices demanded proved harsher than expected. Some clans felt exploited,
    believing their suffering served no clear purpose. Tension simmered, and loyalty
    to <CityName> grew uncertain.
