  mIntroMessage: <CityName> entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes,
    and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened
    stability. Survival depended on how <CityName> navigated obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: "A surge in trade caravans and tribute filled <CityName>\u2019s
    coffers with grain, coin, and exotic goods. Prosperity swelled across the realm\u2014but
    so did envy, greed, and quiet disputes over who deserved the spoils."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive

  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The distribution was carried out with transparency and care. Villages praised
    <CityName> for its generosity, and the shared prosperity strengthened trust between
    the people and their rulers.
  - Accusations of favouritism spread as certain villages claimed they received less
    than promised. The attempt at fairness only deepened rivalry, and murmurs of
    injustice echoed across the realm.
  - Merchants responded with gratitude, expanding their caravans and bringing even
    more wealth into <CityName>. Trade flourished, and the realm enjoyed a surge
    of prosperity and goodwill.
  - Some merchants exploited the leniency, hoarding profits and refusing to reinvest
    in the city. Their greed angered the populace, and resentment toward the merchant
    guild grew sharply.
  - The nobles fulfilled their duty with honour, ensuring fair management and smooth
    distribution. Their cooperation stabilized the realm and prevented conflict among
    the classes.
  - The nobles seized more than their share, enriching their estates while giving
    little back to the common people. Envy and outrage spread across <CityName>,
    and several houses came under open criticism.
  - The festival drew crowds from every corner of the realm. Music, food, and trade
    revived spirits, and the shared celebration strengthened unity within <CityName>.
  - The festivities spiraled into chaos when prices inflated and tempers flared.
    Arguments turned to brawls, thieves prowled the stalls, and the festival ended
    in disorder rather than joy.
  - "The increased vigilance deterred thieves and ensured every coin was accounted
    for. Confidence in <CityName>\u2019s governance grew, and corruption briefly
    receded from public concern."
  - The sudden increase in scrutiny offended powerful officials and merchants, who
    felt accused without cause. Rumours of mistrust spread, and tensions rose between
    the guards and the elite of <CityName>.
