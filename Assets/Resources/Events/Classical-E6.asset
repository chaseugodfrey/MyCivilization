  mIntroMessage: <CityName> had strengthened into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and a growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances had expanded
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshaped its borders. Prosperity had
    risen, but so had rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balanced
    ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative
    age.
  mActionMessage: Floods strike your civilisation, testing its infrastructure and
    unity.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Mobilise engineers to reinforce walls, aqueducts, and public structures.
  - Evacuate citizens to rural estates and temples outside the danger zone.
  - Hold religious rites asking the gods for protection and mercy.
  - Deploy the army to maintain order and deliver emergency aid.
  - Create emergency granaries and water reserves for public use.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Teams of builders and engineers stabilise infrastructure just in time. Citizens
    praise the swift response, and the damage is contained before it spreads.
  - "Reinforcement efforts come too late. Key structures collapse, causing casualties
    and eroding the population\u2019s confidence in state protection."
  - The evacuation is orderly and efficient, saving countless lives. Rural communities
    welcome refugees, strengthening bonds across regions.
  - The evacuation becomes chaotic. Crowded roads and poor coordination trigger panic,
    leading to injuries and mistrust in government command.
  - Citizens gather in temples to offer prayers and sacrifices, finding unity and
    calm. The rites give hope, helping the population endure hardship.
  - Priests disagree on the correct rites, causing confusion and fear. Citizens question
    divine favour and blame the priesthood for misinterpreting omens.
  - Soldiers act with discipline and compassion, restoring order and delivering supplies.
    Their presence reassures citizens and prevents looting.
  - Some soldiers abuse their authority or prioritize elite districts. Complaints
    spread rapidly, igniting outrage and damaging military reputation.
  - "The reserves sustain the population throughout the disaster. Citizens praise
    the state\u2019s foresight, and famine is averted."
  - Supplies are insufficient or poorly guarded. Thieves raid the reserves, causing
    shortages and intensifying unrest.
