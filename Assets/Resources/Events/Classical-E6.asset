  mIntroMessage: <CityName> had strengthened into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and a growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances had expanded
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshaped its borders. Prosperity had
    risen, but so had rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balanced
    ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative
    age.
  mActionMessage: A difficult season gripped <CityName> as harvest yields fell below
    expectation and water reserves dwindled. Though not yet dire, the pressure tested
    cooperation among households, guilds, and political factions.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - sent labourers to dredge wells and restore neglected irrigation channels.
  - ordered rationing across all districts to stretch remaining supplies.
  - dispatched envoys to request emergency grain from allied city-states.
  - redirected temple offerings toward feeding the poorest households.
  - imposed strict market controls to prevent merchants from raising prices.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The labourers cleared irrigation paths and deepened old wells, uncovering long-blocked
    water flow. The restored channels eased the shortage and renewed hope among the
    city\u2019s districts."
  - Despite the effort, the wells yielded little and several channels collapsed during
    repairs. The failed attempt drained morale and left <CityName> more anxious than
    before.
  - The rationing measures stabilised food distribution and prevented hoarding. Though
    strict, the policy ensured every household received enough to endure the season.
  - Rationing bred resentment as some districts claimed others received better portions.
    Tensions rose, and accusations of corruption spread through the city.
  - "The envoys returned with generous shipments of grain and dried goods. Allies
    praised <CityName>\u2019s diplomacy, and the relief softened the hardship across
    the districts."
  - The envoys returned empty-handed, some allies citing shortages of their own.
    Word of refusal stung civic pride, and many questioned whether <CityName> had
    grown too dependent on outside support.
  - The redirection brought immediate relief to struggling families. Citizens praised
    the act as a noble expression of civic virtue, and support for temple leadership
    grew.
  - Some priests condemned the decision as sacrilege, claiming the gods were deprived
    of their due. Disputes erupted around the temples, deepening unrest during an
    already strained season.
  - The price controls worked as intended, stopping profiteering and keeping essential
    goods affordable. Many citizens praised the government for acting decisively
    and fairly.
  - Merchants rebelled quietly, withdrawing goods from stalls or selling in secret
    at inflated prices. Shortages worsened, and black markets took root across <CityName>.
