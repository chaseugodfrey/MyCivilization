  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: Disputes among the tribemates of <CityName> began to intensify,
    rooted in unresolved grievances and clashing priorities. While unrest simmered
    beneath the surface, the path forward still depended on guidance and dialogue.

  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Leaders gathered around the central fire, voicing frustrations and misunderstandings.
    Through patient dialogue, they rediscovered shared goals and agreed to renewed
    cooperation.
  - Discussions escalated into shouting as old grudges resurfaced. The circle dissolved
    in hostility, worsening the divide and deepening mistrust.
  - Building shelters, digging pits, and crafting tools side by side helped the clans
    reconnect. Cooperation rekindled a sense of unity as shared labour mended emotional
    fractures.
  - Clans disagreed over workload and credit. Accusations of laziness or sabotage
    emerged, turning the project into a battleground of resentment.
  - Clans joined in sacred rituals, offering carvings, herbs, and crafted items.
    The shared spiritual moment softened hearts and reminded them of their ancient
    common roots.
  - Some clans dismissed the ceremony as meaningless, sparking further disagreement.
    Participation became a point of pride or defiance, worsening the internal divide.
  - Respected elders carefully reviewed grievances, delivering fair rulings accepted
    by most. Their wisdom calmed the situation and restored a sense of justice.
  - Clans claimed the elders favoured certain families and rejected their judgments.
    The authority of the elders weakened, intensifying the conflict instead of resolving
    it.
  - A communal feast rekindled bonds as clans traded stories and songs. Laughter
    replaced bitterness, reminding everyone of the ties that bound the tribe together.
  - Arguments erupted over food distribution or seating arrangements. What was meant
    as reconciliation became another flashpoint for division.
