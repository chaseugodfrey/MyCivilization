  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: An unfamiliar sickness spread throughout <CityName>, killing many
    able people, which threatened to wipe out the settlement.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: DISEASE OUTBREAK
  mOptionMessages:
  - isolated the sick in a separate camp to prevent further spread.
  - sent runners from <CityName> to neighbouring tribes in search of herbal remedies.
  - performed a grand cleansing ritual using smoke, ash, and sacred chants.
  - increased hunting and gathering efforts to support the weakened population.
  - designated a sacred healing area healers could tend to the sick.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The quarantine slows the illness as healers tend to the afflicted with herbs
    and rituals. Fear remains, but the tribe sees hope in the controlled spread.
  - Families protest the separation, sneaking into the isolation camp and undermining
    containment. The sickness spreads faster than before, creating panic.
  - The runners return with rare herbs and knowledge of treatments. Healers incorporate
    these remedies quickly, slowing the disease and restoring hope.
  - The neighbouring tribes refuse help or provide incorrect knowledge. The remedies
    fail, wasting time and resources as the sickness worsens.
  - "The ritual lifts the tribe\u2019s spirits and reduces fear. Whether through
    belief or coincidence, symptoms ease slightly, and morale strengthens."
  - The ritual fails to show any effect. Some accuse the shamans of incompetence,
    while others blame specific clans for angering the spirits, intensifying social
    strain.
  - Healthy hunters and gatherers push themselves to provide for all. Their efforts
    sustain the tribe through the worst days of the outbreak, preventing starvation.
  - The intensified work leads to exhaustion and injuries. With fewer capable hunters,
    food shortages worsen, compounding the crisis.
  - The healing area becomes a place of focused care and disciplined treatment. Healers
    innovate new methods, gradually stabilising the afflicted.
  - Restrictions frustrate families barred from visiting loved ones. Anger builds
    toward the healers, disrupting treatment and fracturing community trust.
