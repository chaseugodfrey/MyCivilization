  mIntroMessage: <CityName> had strengthened into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and a growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances had expanded
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshaped its borders. Prosperity had
    risen, but so had rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balanced
    ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative
    age.
  mActionMessage: Growing cities strain under class tensions, rival guilds, and political
    clubs. Competing interests threaten to fracture civic unity.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Create a council of guilds to negotiate disputes formally.
  - Deploy magistrates to mediate disputes directly in the streets.
  - Fund a public works project to provide employment and reduce tensions.
  - Support a philosopher-led civic campaign promoting shared identity.
  - Allow each faction temporary autonomy to self-govern locally.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The guilds meet under structured dialogue, finally airing grievances in a civil
    manner. Compromise becomes possible, and productivity rises as tensions cool.
  - Rival guilds use the council as a stage for power plays. Old disagreements ignite
    into fresh feuds, worsening the struggle for influence within the city.
  - The presence of magistrates reassures citizens and discourages violence. Their
    impartial rulings restore a sense of order and fairness.
  - Magistrates are accused of favoritism, fueling resentment. Crowds begin resisting
    their authority, escalating rather than resolving conflict.
  - New jobs ease competition and ease resentment among the lower classes. The project
    becomes a symbol of civic unity, improving morale across districts.
  - Costs balloon and supplies vanish under corruption. Workers riot after payment
    delays, turning a hopeful project into a political disaster.
  - Philosophers present compelling arguments for unity, reminding citizens of common
    heritage and purpose. Conflicts fade as people rally around shared ideals.
  - Philosophers divide into factions themselves, each claiming the true interpretation
    of civic virtue. Their debates spill into the streets, worsening unrest.
  - Autonomy eases immediate pressure, giving time for tempers to settle. Citizens
    appreciate the breathing room and begin cooperating voluntarily.
  - Local leaders turn autonomy into power grabs, entrenching divisions. Regional
    loyalty grows stronger than loyalty to the state itself.
