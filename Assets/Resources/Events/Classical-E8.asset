  mIntroMessage: <CityName> had strengthened into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and a growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances had expanded
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshaped its borders. Prosperity had
    risen, but so had rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balanced
    ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative
    age.
  mActionMessage: Reports arrived that a neighbouring city-state had begun expanding
    into contested farmlands and trade routes near <CityName>. Though no conflict
    had erupted, tensions rose as the threat to vital resources became clear.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - sent diplomats to clarify territorial boundaries and ease tensions.
  - stationed patrols along the contested routes to assert presence.
  - offered shared farming or trade rights to prevent conflict.
  - held a council meeting to decide whether to prepare for war.
  - sent spies to learn the intentions of the encroaching city-state.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The diplomats returned with a favourable agreement, and the neighbouring city-state
    withdrew from the disputed lands. Calm returned to the region, and <CityName>
    earned praise for resolving the matter peacefully.
  - "The neighbouring leaders dismissed the diplomats\u2019 appeals, insisting the
    lands were theirs by right. Tensions escalated, and many feared open conflict
    was drawing nearer."
  - "The disciplined patrols discouraged further encroachment, signalling <CityName>\u2019s
    resolve without provoking hostility. Farmers and traders felt protected once
    more."
  - The patrols were interpreted as aggression, prompting the rival city-state to
    mobilise its own forces. The border grew militarised, and anxiety spread among
    the citizens.
  - The proposal was welcomed, creating a cooperative arrangement that benefited
    both sides. The shared fields flourished, and trade between the cities grew more
    prosperous than before.
  - "The offer was seen as a sign of weakness, emboldening the rival city-state to
    push further into contested territory. <CityName>\u2019s goodwill was exploited
    rather than respected."
  - The council agreed on a defensive strategy that reassured the populace without
    committing to conflict. Morale strengthened, and the city felt united and vigilant.
  - The council fractured into factions advocating different responses. Rumours spread
    of impending war, and fear gripped the districts, weakening public confidence.
  - The spies uncovered plans for expansion but also internal weaknesses, allowing
    <CityName> to act strategically and prevent further advances without bloodshed.
  - The spies were discovered and captured, inflaming tensions. The rival city-state
    accused <CityName> of subterfuge, and relations deteriorated sharply.
