  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: "Signs of increased activity from a neighbouring tribe appeared
    near <CityName>\u2019s hunting grounds. Their presence threatened to strain vital
    food sources, but the situation had not yet escalated into open conflict."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - sent a small peace-bearing delegation carrying symbolic gifts.
  - prepared a ceremonial hunt to demonstrate strength without hostility.
  - had the shamans mediate through shared spiritual rites with the rival tribe.
  - strengthened the border patrols around <CityName> to discourage further encroachment.
  - invited the rival tribe to a shared competition of skill and endurance.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The neighbouring tribe accepted the offerings graciously. Shared meals and exchanged
    stories cooled tempers, laid the groundwork for future cooperation.
  - The gifts are misinterpreted as bribes or signs of weakness. The neighbouring
    tribe grew more aggressive, emboldened by what they perceived as submission.
  - Your hunters displayed mastery and discipline, impressed the neighbouring tribe.
    Respect replaced tension, and both sides agreed to avoid future disputes.
  - The display backfired as rival hunters interpreted it as a challenge. Clashes
    break out at the territory edge, fuelled anger and escalated the conflict.
  - The shamans entered a trance-like communion, emerged with signs interpreted as
    mutual favour. Spiritual harmony spread, eased tensions between tribes.
  - The rival tribe accused your shamans of manipulation. Spiritual distrust hardened
    positions, made negotiation far more difficult in the future.
  - "The patrols operated with discipline, avoiding provocation while clearly protecting
    your land. The rival tribe backed off, respected your tribe\u2019s vigilance."
  - A misinterpreted gesture or accidental encounter sparked violence along the border.
    The neighbouring tribe mobilised, transformed the tension into open threat.
  - The competition became a celebration of strength rather than hostility. Laughter
    broke through rivalry as participants recognised shared values of courage and
    honour.
  - The contests turned aggressive as tempers flared. Accusations of cheating spread
    rapidly, deepening resentment and worsened relations.
