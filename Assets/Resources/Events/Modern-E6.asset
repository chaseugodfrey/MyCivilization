  mIntroMessage: Industrial change reshaped <CityName> with new technologies, expanding
    factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenged old systems,
    while global trade raised both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerated faster
    than society adapted, and <CityName> had to balance progress with stability as
    it confronted competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.
  mActionMessage: Industrial demand outpaced supply as coal reserves thinned and
    timber shipments slowed. Factories strained to operate, and the city faced hard
    choices about rationing and imports.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - redirected factory shifts to conserve dwindling fuel reserves.
  - sent procurement teams to distant regions in search of new suppliers.
  - negotiated emergency resource contracts with rival industrial cities.
  - introduced strict rationing for coal and metals across all workshops.
  - invested in experimental substitutes for traditional fuel sources.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The reduced shifts slowed consumption and stabilised fuel use. Factories adapted
    efficiently, and <CityName> avoided a total shutdown while awaiting new shipments.
  - The reduced hours crippled production, worsening economic pressure. Workers saw
    pay cuts, resentment grew, and some factories risked closure.
  - The teams secured promising contracts abroad, bringing in fresh coal and materials.
    Relief arrived just in time, restoring confidence across the factory districts.
  - "The journeys proved costly and fruitless\u2014distant suppliers were already
    overcommitted. The failed mission drained funds and morale alike."
  - Rival cities agreed to limited support, easing immediate shortages. Though uneasy,
    the cooperation prevented industrial collapse and kept factories running.
  - "The rivals saw <CityName>\u2019s desperation and demanded steep prices. Accepting
    the terms sparked outrage among merchants and workers, who felt exploited."
  - The rationing was implemented fairly, and most factories adapted by prioritising
    essential goods. The city endured the shortage without widespread disruption.
  - The rationing ignited competition among workshops, with accusations of hidden
    reserves and unequal treatment. Several guilds staged protests, deepening internal
    strife.
  - The experiments yielded a workable alternative, reducing dependence on scarce
    coal. The breakthrough impressed neighbouring cities and secured <CityName> a
    technological edge.
  - The substitutes failed in testing, damaging machines and wasting resources. Critics
    attacked the failed gamble, calling it reckless during an already fragile crisis.
