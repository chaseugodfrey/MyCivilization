  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: As humanity spreads across planets, cultures diverge. Colonists,
    Earth-born citizens, AI-driven societies, and genetically modified populations
    clash over identity, autonomy, and the future of civilisation.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Host holographic cross-colony forums to encourage cultural exchange.
  - Fund cross-planet educational programs standardising history and ethics curricula.
  - Recognise and protect unique planetary cultures through interstellar legislation.
  - "Deploy cultural ambassadors\u2014trained mediators fluent in multiple colony
    customs."
  - Encourage interplanetary festivals showcasing arts, cuisine, and innovation from
    all colonies.

  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Shared experiences and immersive communication soften misunderstandings across
    worlds. Unity strengthens as citizens find pride in a multi-planet identity.
  - Activist groups hijack the forums, spreading inflammatory messages. Interplanetary
    distrust deepens as conversations collapse into ideological chaos.
  - Students across planets develop a shared foundational worldview, reducing tension
    between colonies. A new generation embraces unity over division.
  - Colonies accuse Earth of cultural imperialism. Protests break out demanding curriculum
    independence, worsening friction.
  - Granting formal protection earns widespread respect. Colonies feel acknowledged,
    leading to renewed diplomatic cooperation.
  - Some factions interpret the legislation as implicit favoritism, reigniting old
    rivalries. Accusations of political bias spread.
  - Ambassadors excel at bridging divides, easing long-standing resentments. Tensions
    cool as misunderstandings are clarified peacefully.
  - Ambassadors are rejected by extremist groups who view them as tools of central
    authority. Hostility increases in border colonies.
  - Festivals become celebrated traditions across the solar system, fostering joy
    and camaraderie. Citizens embrace diversity as a hallmark of civilisation.
  - Attempted sabotage at one event sparks fear. Colonies blame each other for the
    attack, worsening tensions.
