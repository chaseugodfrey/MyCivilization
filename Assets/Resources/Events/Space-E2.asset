  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: Hyper-adaptive automation and self-replicating fabrication fleets
    triggered an era of unprecedented abundance across <CityName>. Wealth surged
    through the networks of human and synthetic citizens alike, yet power concentrated
    dangerously in the hands of a few megacorporate clusters.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - implemented wealth-redistribution protocols to ensure automated gains reached
    all citizens.
  - placed regulatory overseers on megacorporate clusters to limit concentration
    of power.
  - expanded open-source fabrication networks so smaller colonies could compete with
    corporate fleets.
  - invited corporate leaders to a prosperity summit to negotiate fairer economic
    terms.
  - redirected surplus automation output toward public megastructure projects that
    benefited the entire civilisation.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The protocols worked seamlessly, uplifting countless communities across <CityName>.
    Social stability improved, and trust grew between human and synthetic citizens
    alike.
  - "Corporations exploited loopholes in the system, undermining the redistribution
    effort. Inequality worsened, and resentment toward <CityName>\u2019s leadership
    intensified."
  - The overseers exposed corrupt algorithms and unfair resource siphons. Corporate
    influence weakened, and economic balance returned to the interstellar markets.
  - "The corporations retaliated by throttling key infrastructure. Supply chains
    faltered across <CityName>, causing panic and weakening the government\u2019s
    authority."
  - The open-source expansion sparked a renaissance of innovation. Independent colonies
    thrived, and <CityName> diversified its economy beyond corporate reliance.
  - Unregulated fabrication led to unsafe designs and black-market production. Accidents
    and sabotage incidents surged, destabilising several frontier settlements.
  - After intense debate, the summit produced a cooperative economic charter. Corporate
    leaders accepted new ethical constraints, and a more sustainable prosperity emerged
    across <CityName>.
  - The summit failed as CEOs refused compromise. Their unified stance emboldened
    them, and their influence over automated fleets grew stronger than before.
  - "The megastructure projects\u2014orbital habitats, energy arrays, and transit
    rings\u2014brought lasting benefits. Citizens celebrated <CityName>\u2019s vision,
    and prosperity expanded beyond measure."
  - The projects consumed enormous resources and suffered catastrophic system failures.
    Blame spread quickly, and many accused <CityName>'s leaders of wasting the automation
    surplus on unsustainable ambitions.
