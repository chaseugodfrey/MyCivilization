  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: "A wave of cultural renewal swept through the clans of <CityName>,
    inspiring new interpretations of traditions, rituals, and ancestral customs.
    The city\u2019s unity grew stronger in some ways and more uncertain in others,
    depending on how these evolving practices were embraced."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - 'held a Great Fire Gathering where all the clans of <CityName> voiced their beliefs. '
  - "asked the shamans to conduct a spirit\u2011walk, seeking guidance from the all-fathers
    of <CityName>."
  - permitted each clan to freely embrace its customs without interference.
  - conducted a symbolic hunt requiring warriors from all clans to cooperate, in
    an effort to unite the clans.
  - "gave the youth of the different clans to form a cross\u2011clan learning circle."

  mOutcomeMessages:
  - At the Great Fire Gathering, the clans shared their stories and sacred songs.
    Old differences softened as the people recognised the shared roots beneath their
    customs, and warmth gradually softened long-standing tension.
  - The gathering quickly descended into shouting as old grievances resurfaced. Clans
    stormed away from the fire, and the unity meant to be strengthened instead fractured
    even further.
  - The shamans returned from their spirit-walk with visions of the clan totems walking
    side by side. Their message of harmony reassured the people, restoring faith
    that the ancestors favoured unity over discord.
  - The shamans emerged with conflicting visions, each claiming a different clan
    was divinely favoured. Suspicion spread swiftly through <CityName>, deepening
    spiritual uncertainty and mistrust.
  - With freedom to express their customs openly, the clans celebrated their songs,
    carvings, and rites. Curiosity replaced jealousy as traditions flourished peacefully
    in parallel.
  - The clans drifted further apart as their symbols and customs became barriers
    instead of bridges. Before long, families refused to share hunts or communal
    meals.
  - The unified hunting band succeeded, returning with abundant game. Their shared
    triumph became a legend retold around fires, renewing trust among the various
    clans.
  - "The hunt ended in chaos when miscommunication caused injury and lost prey. The
    failure became a cautionary tale, embodying <CityName>\u2019s fractured spirit."
  - Young hunters and gatherers exchanged skills and formed friendships that crossed
    clan boundaries. Their unity stirred optimism among the elders, hinting at a
    more harmonious future.
  - A rebellion within <CityName> condemned the learning circle as a threat to tradition
    and forbade further participation. The youth grew resentful, widening the rift
    between generations and clans alike.
