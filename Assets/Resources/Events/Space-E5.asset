  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: "A controversial discovery which shows evidence of consciousness-like
    behaviour in dark-matter fluctuations spread through <CityName>, forcing philosophers,
    scientists, and spiritual orders to confront civilisation\u2019s deepest ethical
    foundations."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - assembled a cross-disciplinary council to study the dark-matter behaviour and
    interpret its meaning.
  - broadcast the findings openly to all star systems to ensure transparency and
    shared understanding.
  - restricted further research until ethical guidelines were established for interacting
    with potential nonhuman consciousness.
  - funded deep-space observatories to expand monitoring of dark-matter regions across
    <CityName>.
  - "consulted spiritual orders and philosophical traditions to guide <CityName>\u2019s
    response to the discovery."
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The council uncovered patterns suggesting peaceful intent rather than hostility.
    Their findings unified scientific and cultural communities, easing fear and inspiring
    wonder across <CityName>.
  - The council fractured into competing interpretations, accusing one another of
    bias. Their disagreements ignited public confusion and intensified ideological
    divides.
  - The open broadcast sparked interstellar collaboration. Worlds shared data freely,
    and <CityName> entered a new age of collective exploration and philosophical
    growth.
  - The revelation triggered panic in several sectors. Populations interpreted the
    discovery as a looming cosmic threat, leading to unrest, hoarding, and widespread
    anxiety.
  - "The pause allowed ethicists and scientists to craft a clear, principled approach.
    Their guidelines became a cornerstone of responsible cosmic exploration and strengthened
    <CityName>\u2019s moral authority."
  - The restriction was condemned by research factions who accused <CityName> of
    suppressing progress. Secret investigations proliferated, risking dangerous or
    uncontrolled breakthroughs.
  - "The observatories detected stable, repeating patterns that hinted at structured
    communication. Excitement surged, and confidence grew in <CityName>\u2019s scientific
    leadership."
  - "The expanded surveillance revealed alarming anomalies\u2014mass fluctuations
    that destabilised local spacetime. Fear spread, and some worlds demanded immediate
    militarisation."
  - The spiritual consultation brought calm reflection to the realm. Many citizens
    embraced a renewed sense of unity, seeing the discovery as a shared cosmic mystery
    rather than a threat.
  - Rival spiritual factions offered conflicting interpretations, each claiming exclusive
    understanding of the phenomenon. Their disputes reignited ancient divisions across
    <CityName>.
