  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: A synthetic pathogen escaped a quantum-containment lab, mutating
    as it travelled between biological, digital, and hybrid lifeforms. The outbreak
    spread through <CityName> with alarming speed, threatening the stability of interstellar
    civilisation.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - activated quantum firewalls to isolate infected digital networks before the pathogen
    could propagate.
  - mobilised bio-synthetic response teams equipped with adaptive nanomedicine to
    treat emerging cases.
  - shut down interlinked cybernetic transit channels to slow multi-species cross-infection.
  - "deployed rapid-fabrication units to produce custom anti-viral nanites tailored
    to the pathogen\u2019s mutations."
  - enforced a citywide tri-layer quarantine separating biological, digital, and
    hybrid populations.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The firewalls contained the digital strain completely, halting its spread through
    data streams and cybernetic minds. Critical systems stabilised, and confidence
    in <CityName>\u2019s defenses surged."
  - The pathogen adapted faster than expected, slipping through encrypted channels.
    Entire network clusters collapsed, and digital citizens suffered catastrophic
    cognitive failures.
  - The response teams neutralised early mutations with precision. Recovery rates
    climbed, and previously infected hybrids regained stable function, boosting morale
    across <CityName>.
  - "The nanomedicine malfunctioned under the pathogen\u2019s rapid shifts, causing
    unpredictable side effects. Panic spread as treatment centers became overwhelmed
    with new complications."
  - The shutdown prevented cross-contamination between districts, drastically slowing
    the outbreak. Infection maps stabilised long enough for experts to regain control.
  - The closures stranded thousands across multiple systems. Trade stalled, supply
    shortages erupted, and civil unrest intensified as isolation dragged on.
  - "The nanites adapted flawlessly, dismantling the pathogen\u2019s evolving structures.
    Infection clusters dissolved, and <CityName> hailed the breakthrough as a triumph
    of innovation."
  - The nanites proved too unstable, merging unpredictably with the pathogen. The
    hybrid strain became more aggressive, accelerating transmission across all lifeforms.
  - The layered quarantine prevented cross-species mutation cycles. Transmission
    rates plummeted, allowing time for coordinated relief efforts and long-term containment.
  - The strict segregation caused widespread emotional strain and political backlash.
    Families were divided, hybrid citizens felt targeted, and accusations of discrimination
    fractured social unity.
