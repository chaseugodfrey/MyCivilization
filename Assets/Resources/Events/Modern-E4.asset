  mIntroMessage: Industrial change reshaped <CityName> with new technologies, expanding
    factories, and rapid population growth. Political movements challenged old systems,
    while global trade raised both opportunity and risk. Innovation accelerated faster
    than society adapted, and <CityName> had to balance progress with stability as
    it confronted competition, unrest, and evolving expectations from its citizens.
  mActionMessage: A breakthrough in machinery spread through <CityName>, promising
    faster production, reduced labour strain, and new innovations. How the city adopted
    these innovations would reshape its future.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - hosted demonstrations where engineers displayed the new machinery in action.
  - granted funding to workshops experimenting with mechanised production methods.
  - restricted initial use of the innovation to skilled engineers for careful testing.
  - integrated the breakthrough into major factories to boost output.
  - sent prototypes as diplomatic gifts to strengthen foreign relations.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The demonstrations impressed craftsmen, investors, and officials alike. Confidence
    in the innovation spread quickly, and several factories adopted the new machinery
    with remarkable success.
  - The machines malfunctioned during the demonstrations, alarming spectators and
    investors. Doubts spread rapidly, and support for the breakthrough weakened before
    it could gain traction.
  - The workshops made groundbreaking improvements, adapting the innovation into
    practical, efficient designs. <CityName> soon gained a reputation for mechanical
    ingenuity.
  - The workshops drained funds without producing meaningful progress. Fierce competition
    between guilds led to accusations of waste and mismanagement, dampening enthusiasm
    for the project.
  - The engineers refined the invention with precision, resolving early flaws and
    ensuring its safe adoption. When released to the public, the improved machine
    was widely praised.
  - The secrecy surrounding the testing raised suspicion among workers and guilds.
    Rumours of hidden dangers spread, and resentment built even before the innovation
    was revealed.
  - Productivity surged as factories embraced the innovation. Workers saw reduced
    strain, profits increased, and <CityName> enjoyed a new wave of industrial growth.
  - "The rapid integration proved unstable\u2014several factories suffered breakdowns
    or accidents. Workers blamed rushed implementation, and support for the new technology
    faltered."
  - "Foreign dignitaries were astonished by the prototypes and praised <CityName>\u2019s
    craftsmanship. The gifts opened doors to new trade deals and strengthened regional
    alliances."
  - Some neighbouring powers interpreted the prototypes as strategic threats. Suspicion
    grew, and a few states tightened borders, turning diplomacy tense and uncertain.
