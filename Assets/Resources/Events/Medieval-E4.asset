  mIntroMessage: <CityName> entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes,
    and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened
    stability. Survival depended on how <CityName> navigated obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: A blacksmith guild unveiled a remarkable innovation,which could
    greatly improve <CityName>'s arsenal of weaponry. Whether this invention served
    the realm or endangered it depended entirely on what <CityName> did with it.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - granted the guild exclusive rights to refine the invention even further.
  - presented the design to the ruling council to decide on its proper use.
  - armed a select company of knights with prototypes to test the innovation in controlled
    trials.
  - shared the invention with all guilds to encourage collaborative development.
  - locked the plans in the royal archive until <CityName>'s leaders deemed it safe
    to wield such power.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The guild handled the task with integrity, improving the design and producing
    a safer, stronger weapon. Their loyalty deepened, and <CityName> gained a decisive
    standing in the realm's kingdoms for years to come.
  - The guild grew secretive and arrogant, hoarding knowledge and demanding greater
    influence in court. Their monopoly unsettled rival guilds and sowed distrust
    throughout <CityName>.
  - "The council deliberated wisely and established clear rules for the weapon\u2019s
    deployment. Their unified decision strengthened confidence in <CityName>\u2019s
    leadership and prevented any reckless use."
  - The council splintered into factions, each arguing for control of the invention.
    Political rivalry intensified, and the weapon became a symbol of division rather
    than progress.
  - "The knights mastered the new weapon swiftly and proved its effectiveness without
    incident. Their success boosted morale and demonstrated <CityName>\u2019s growing
    military prowess."
  - "The prototypes malfunctioned during testing, injuring several knights and causing
    panic within the ranks. Doubt spread across <CityName> and the guild\u2019s reputation
    suffered greatly."
  - "The guilds worked together with rare harmony, blending their expertise to perfect
    the innovation. The collaboration forged new alliances and strengthened <CityName>\u2019s
    technological standing."
  - Rival guilds accused one another of sabotage. What began as collaboration deteriorated
    into bitter competition, sparking feuds that disrupted production across the
    realm.
  - "The cautious choice earned respect from priests and elders, who praised <CityName>\u2019s
    restraint. Peace held firm, and rumours of reckless ambition faded from public
    concern."
  - The decision frustrated the blacksmith guild, who felt their work was dismissed.
    Their resentment grew, and several artisans left <CityName> for rival kingdoms,
    taking their expertise with them.
