  mIntroMessage: <CityName> enters an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shapes governance, merchants connect distant routes,
    and scholars preserve knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threaten

    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.

  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The assembly restores trust through open dialogue. Nobles leave satisfied, and
    unity returns to the realm\u2019s leadership."
  - Arguments escalate into threats as rival houses refuse compromise. The assembly
    breaks down, deepening political fractures.
  - "The knight\u2019s honourable reputation calms tensions. Nobles trust their judgment,
    and disputes are settled peacefully."
  - Some nobles accuse the knight of bias and manipulation. Their distrust grows,
    and hidden alliances begin to form against the crown.
  - Warm food, music, and generous hospitality rekindle camaraderie among nobles.
    Old friendships are restored over wine and song.
  - A feud between two houses erupts during the feast, turning celebration into humiliation
    for the crown. Tensions worsen overnight.
  - A disciplined show of force discourages rebellion. Nobles reconsider rash actions,
    opting for negotiation instead.
  - The militarization alarms nobles, who interpret it as oppression. Several houses
    quietly begin gathering troops.
  - The marriages forge strong alliances, intertwining the fate of noble houses with
    the throne. Stability returns.
  - The alliances alienate excluded families, who grow jealous and bitter. Political
    scheming intensifies behind closed doors.
