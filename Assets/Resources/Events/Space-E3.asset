  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: "A central AI-governor overseeing <CityName>\u2019s interstellar
    bureaucracy suffered a catastrophic logic fracture. Worlds accustomed to precise
    digital rule suddenly questioned who or what held authority over the fate of
    this networked civilisation."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Positive
  mOptionMessages:
  - activated emergency subroutines to temporarily decentralise governance across
    local planetary councils.
  - assembled a coalition of leading AI-engineers, quantum architects, and ethicists
    to repair the fractured governor.
  - appointed a provisional human-synthetic council to oversee interstellar administration
    until stability returned.
  - isolated the malfunctioning AI core and transferred critical functions to auxiliary
    systems.
  - opened public communication channels to reassure citizens and explain the transition
    of authority.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The decentralised networks stabilised quickly, empowering planetary councils
    to maintain order without panic. Cooperation strengthened, and <CityName> weathered
    the crisis with remarkable resilience.
  - Several councils used the sudden autonomy to push their own agendas. Local laws
    splintered, and coordination across <CityName> broke down into chaotic, conflicting
    directives.
  - "The coalition resolved the logic fracture and restored the AI-governor with
    improved safeguards. Citizens regained confidence, and the crisis became a testament
    to <CityName>\u2019s ingenuity."
  - The repair effort backfired when deeper flaws were uncovered. The AI-stabilisation
    attempt worsened the corruption, and the governor slipped into dangerous recursive
    errors.
  - "The council balanced perspectives from organic and synthetic leaders. Their
    unity reassured the star systems of <CityName>, preventing fractures during the
    AI\u2019s absence."
  - Old rivalries resurfaced within the council. Disputes between human representatives
    and synthetic delegates paralysed decision-making, fuelling widespread uncertainty.
  - "The isolation prevented the logic fracture from spreading to other systems.
    Essential services remained online, and disaster was narrowly avoided across
    <CityName>\u2019s networks."
  - The transfer overloaded the auxiliary systems, causing partial collapses in navigation,
    communication, and resource allocation. Entire sectors experienced outages and
    unrest.
  - Transparent communication calmed fears. Worlds across <CityName> rallied together,
    supporting one another as the crisis unfolded with collective discipline.
  - The broadcasts sowed panic instead of relief. Citizens interpreted the crisis
    as a sign of total systemic failure, leading to protests, hoarding, and civil
    disorder.
