  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: A rogue solar flare from a nearby unstable star erupted without
    warning, frying orbital habitats, blinding sensor networks, and threatening <CityName>
    with the brink of destruction.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - deployed shield-drones to reinforce damaged orbital habitats and restore structural
    integrity.
  - rerouted power through deep-buried superconductive grids to reboot sensor networks
    safely.
  - evacuated affected orbital clusters to hardened planetary shelters before secondary
    flare activity.
  - launched automated repair swarms to rebuild scorched infrastructure in low-orbit
    lanes.
  - commissioned astro-physicists to predict further instability and advise defensive
    measures.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The shield-drones stabilised the battered habitats, preventing hull breaches
    and saving hundreds of residents. Their quick deployment restored calm and confidence
    in <CityName>\u2019s orbital safety protocols."
  - "The drones overloaded under the flare\u2019s residual radiation and failed mid-operation.
    Several habitats sustained additional damage, and evacuation casualties rose
    sharply."
  - "The underground grids absorbed the flare\u2019s interference, allowing critical
    sensors to reboot more quickly than expected. Restored vision of nearby space
    lanes prevented further disasters."
  - Residual radiation surged through the system and fried several grid nodes. The
    partial reboot produced corrupted data, leaving <CityName> effectively blind
    to incoming traffic.
  - The evacuation proceeded smoothly, clearing vulnerable habitats before a secondary
    pulse struck. Thousands were protected, and the planetary shelters handled the
    influx without strain.
  - Evacuation ships struggled with damaged navigation systems, causing delays and
    collisions. Lives were lost during the confusion, and public outrage flared across
    multiple districts.
  - The swarms worked at impressive speed, restoring key orbital lanes and patching
    damaged arrays. Their efficiency helped <CityName> recover far sooner than analysts
    predicted.
  - "The flare disrupted the swarms\u2019 coordination signals, sending several units
    into malfunction. Debris struck nearby habitats, compounding the damage and eroding
    public trust."
  - "The scientists identified a pattern in the star\u2019s fluctuations and issued
    precise warnings. Their models allowed <CityName> to shield vulnerable stations
    before new bursts arrived."
  - The predictions proved wildly inaccurate, leaving defenses misaligned during
    a follow-up flare. Citizens accused the experts of negligence, deepening fear
    and frustration.
