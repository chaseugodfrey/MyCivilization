  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: A difficult season settled over <CityName> as food stores thinned
    and clean water grew harder to find. Though not yet catastrophic, the strain
    tested cooperation and resourcefulness across the settlement.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - sent a scouting party into distant wildlands to search for new sources of food.
  - performed a ritual of offering to the earth spirits, praying for more resources.
  - "consolidated resources by merging all of <CityName>\u2019s stores together temporarily."
  - attempted experimental traps to catch larger prey that could be eaten.
  - nomadically relocated a portion of <CityName> to follow migrating herds.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The scouting party returned with news of hidden groves, fresh streams, and scattered
    herds. Their discoveries eased the growing worry in <CityName>, and the clans
    praised their courage and resourcefulness.
  - The scouts found little beyond barren ground and lurking predators. Many never
    returned, and their disappearance weighed heavily on the clans, deepening the
    sense of strain and uncertainty.
  - The offering was received with reverence, and soon after, gentle rains nourished
    the soil and revived withering plants. Many in <CityName> believed the spirits
    had heard their plea, restoring hope across the settlement.
  - The ritual passed without any sign or change in fortune. Doubt spread among the
    people of <CityName>, and some whispered that the spirits had turned away, fraying
    spiritual confidence when unity was most needed.
  - By merging their stores, the clans discovered overlooked reserves and eliminated
    wasteful practices. Rations stabilised, and cooperation strengthened as <CityName>
    weathered the season together.
  - The consolidation bred suspicion, with clans accusing one another of hiding supplies
    or taking more than their share. Trust eroded rapidly, and the shared stores
    became a source of tension rather than relief.
  - The experimental traps succeeded, capturing larger prey than the clans had managed
    in many seasons. The unexpected bounty lifted morale, and inventive thinking
    earned newfound respect in <CityName>.
  - The traps malfunctioned or were destroyed by wild beasts, injuring several hunters
    in the process. Time and materials were wasted, and the clans questioned the
    wisdom of such risky ingenuity.
  - The migrating group found plentiful herds and returned with enough meat to support
    <CityName> through the worst of the season. Their journey reaffirmed the value
    of mobility and adaptability among the clans.
  - "The roaming party faced storms, predators, and scarce game. Many struggled to
    return, bringing little food and great exhaustion. Their ordeal cast a heavy
    shadow over the settlement\u2019s hopes for a stable future."
