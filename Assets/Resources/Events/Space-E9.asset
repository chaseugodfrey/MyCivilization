  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: Rising tensions between gene-altered humans, baseline populations,
    uplifted animals, and fully synthetic intelligences ignited systemic unrest across
    <CityName>. Centuries-old social contracts suddenly strained under the weight
    of evolution.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - convened a multi-species, multi-intelligence mediation council to address grievances
    openly.
  - deployed neutral peacekeeping units composed of mixed populations to deter escalating
    violence.
  - implemented temporary legal reforms to guarantee equal rights across biological
    and synthetic categories.
  - opened cultural exchange hubs to encourage dialogue and reduce tribal tensions.
  - restricted high-risk districts under emergency protocols to prevent large-scale
    riots.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The council exceeded expectations, allowing all groups to voice concerns and
    negotiate shared policies. Mutual respect grew, and several longstanding disputes
    were peacefully resolved.
  - The council collapsed under ideological clashes. Representatives walked out,
    denouncing the process as biased, and hostilities intensified across several
    districts.
  - The diverse peacekeeping units gained trust from every faction, preventing riots
    and stabilising volatile streets. Their presence reassured citizens that fairness
    still existed in <CityName>.
  - Even mixed units were accused of favouritism by rival factions. When skirmishes
    erupted, peacekeepers were overwhelmed, and their failure worsened the unrest.
  - The reforms eased tensions as oppressed groups saw genuine steps toward equality.
    Many factions paused protests, hopeful that permanent legislation would follow.
  - Baseline groups interpreted the reforms as preferential treatment, sparking counter-protests.
    Instead of healing divisions, the sudden changes triggered new waves of conflict.
  - The hubs became popular neutral grounds where species and intelligences shared
    customs, stories, and technologies. Bonds formed, and several key factions publicly
    denounced violence.
  - The hubs became flashpoints for ideological confrontation. Arguments escalated
    into physical clashes, forcing officials to shut them down and worsening distrust.
  - The restrictions prevented several planned uprisings and allowed authorities
    to regain control. Violence subsided, giving negotiators valuable time to work
    toward long-term solutions.
  - The lockdowns angered multiple groups, who saw them as targeted suppression.
    Underground resistance cells formed, and unrest spread to previously stable districts.
