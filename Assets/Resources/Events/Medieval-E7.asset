  mIntroMessage: <CityName> entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes,
    and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened
    stability. Survival depended on how <CityName> navigated obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: The great river burst its banks after violent storms, drowning
    farmland and sweeping away village roads. Cries for aid rose across the countryside,
    and <CityName> was forced to act swiftly to restore order.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - sent knights and workers to reinforce levees, dams, and village walls.
  - evacuated threatened villages to nearby monasteries for shelter.
  - ordered a realm-wide prayer vigil led by influential clergy.
  - The soldiers arrived swiftly, restoring roads, rescuing stranded families, and
    distributing food to the hungry. Their presence brought order and steadiness
    to the shaken countryside.
  - constructed emergency granaries and firebreaks to protect stored goods.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The reinforcements held firm against the rising water. Villages along the riverbank
    were spared further destruction, and gratitude for <CityName>\u2019s quick response
    spread across the countryside."
  - "The efforts proved too late. The makeshift barriers collapsed under the next
    surge, injuring workers and deepening frustration toward <CityName>\u2019s leadership."
  - "The monasteries welcomed the displaced with open arms. Families found safety,
    and the monks\u2019 generosity restored hope during the crisis, strengthening
    bonds between church and realm."
  - "Overcrowding strained the monasteries\u2019 resources. Tempers frayed, sickness
    spread, and some villagers accused <CityName> of abandoning them far from their
    homes."
  - "The vigil united the realm in a rare moment of shared faith. As the storms calmed
    soon after, many believed the heavens had answered, renewing the people\u2019s
    trust in <CityName>."
  - The vigil did little to halt the flooding, and frustration mounted among exhausted
    villagers. Critics mocked the ceremony as an empty gesture while their homes
    washed away.
  - "The army\u2019s strict enforcement angered frightened villagers. Clashes broke
    out over rationing, and resentment grew as some accused the soldiers of heavy-handed
    behaviour."
  - Poor coordination leads to misdelivered supplies. Some soldiers act harshly,
    igniting fear and complaints in already distressed communities.
  - The new granaries preserved vital stores from the damp, and firebreaks saved
    several settlements from ruin. <CityName> secured enough resources to survive
    the aftermath of the floods.
  - The rushed construction led to faulty structures. Grain spoiled, firebreaks failed,
    and the wasted labour demoralised workers already battered by the storms.
