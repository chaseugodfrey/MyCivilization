  mIntroMessage: <CityName> entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes,
    and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened
    stability. Survival depended on how <CityName> navigated obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: "Two influential guilds in <CityName> came to bitter blows over
    rights, privileges, and control of the city\u2019s vital trades. Their rivalry
    spilled into the streets, threatening to spark open violence if no authority
    intervened."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - called both guild leaders to a mediated council to negotiate new terms.
  - "imposed a temporary halt on both guilds\u2019 operations until peace was restored."
  - sent royal guards to separate the factions and secure the affected districts.
  - offered shared contracts and privileges to encourage cooperation between the
    guilds.
  - appointed a neutral magistrate to investigate the dispute and issue a binding
    ruling.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The mediation eased hostilities as both leaders reached a fair agreement. Street
    tensions faded, and <CityName> praised the council\u2019s wisdom."
  - Negotiations collapsed into shouting and accusation. Both guilds left angrier
    than before, and their feud intensified across <CityName>.
  - The enforced pause cooled tempers and prevented violence. With time to reflect,
    both guilds agreed to resume work under revised, peaceful terms.
  - The shutdown enraged guild members who depended on daily wages. Unrest spread
    among workers, and resentment toward <CityName>'s leaders grew quickly.
  - The guards swiftly restored order, dispersing angry mobs before bloodshed occurred.
    Citizens felt safer, and the guilds retreated from open confrontation.
  - "The guards\u2019 presence escalated tensions. Clashes broke out, injuries followed,
    and some citizens accused <CityName> of turning the city into a battlefield."
  - "The incentive united both guilds in cautious partnership. Their shared successes
    gradually mended old grudges, strengthening <CityName>\u2019s commerce."
  - One guild claimed the arrangement favoured the other, fuelling their rivalries.
    The attempted compromise only deepened their bitterness.
  - "The magistrate produced a well-received ruling that balanced both guilds\u2019
    interests. Respect for the law grew, and the feud dissolved under fair judgement."
  - The investigation angered both sides, who claimed the magistrate was biased.
    They rejected the ruling outright, pushing the conflict dangerously close to
    violence.
