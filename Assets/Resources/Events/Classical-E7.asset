  mIntroMessage: <CityName> had strengthened into an organised society with structured
    laws, wider trade, and a growing intellectual life. Roads and alliances had expanded
    its reach, while diplomacy and conflict reshaped its borders. Prosperity had
    risen, but so had rivalries and debates over authority. How <CityName> balanced
    ambition and stability ultimately determined its path through this transformative
    age.
  mActionMessage: Unpredictable storm fronts gathered near <CityName>, threatening
    roads, farms, and vulnerable districts. Citizens prepared as best they could,
    uncertain how severely the tempest might disrupt civic life.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - mobilised builders to reinforce rooftops, walls, and aqueducts.
  - evacuated families from low-lying districts to safer high terraces.
  - constructed temporary barriers along flood-prone avenues.
  - consulted weather-watchers and temple astronomers for storm predictions.
  - secured warehouses and granaries to protect vital supplies from damage.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The builders worked swiftly, strengthening rooftops and shoring up weakened aqueducts.
    When the storm arrived, the reinforced structures held firm, sparing <CityName>
    from major damage.
  - "The rushed reinforcements failed in several districts, with walls buckling and
    rooftops tearing loose. The storm\u2019s impact was harsher than expected, and
    citizens questioned the city\u2019s preparedness."
  - "The evacuation proceeded smoothly, and families found refuge on higher ground.
    When floods swept the lower streets, lives were spared and gratitude toward the
    city\u2019s leadership grew."
  - Confusion and overcrowding plagued the evacuation, causing panic and scattered
    injuries. Some families refused to leave and suffered greatly when the storm
    struck, leading to bitter debate afterward.
  - The barriers held strong as heavy rain poured through the night, diverting water
    away from homes and markets. Citizens praised the foresight that protected their
    livelihoods.
  - "The barriers collapsed under the storm\u2019s force, sending water surging into
    key districts. The failed defenses caused significant damage and undermined trust
    in the city's engineers."
  - The predictions proved accurate, allowing <CityName> to focus defenses where
    they were needed most. Losses were minimal, and the watchers earned renewed respect
    for their guidance.
  - The forecasts were disastrously wrong, leaving the city unprepared in critical
    areas. Citizens accused the watchers of incompetence, and faith in celestial
    guidance faltered.
  - "The precautions saved most of <CityName>\u2019s stored grain and provisions.
    Even after the storm passed, the city had enough supplies to endure the disruptions
    without hardship."
  - Leaks and structural failures ruined much of the stored food despite the preparations.
    The loss was severe, and frustration spread as citizens blamed officials for
    inadequate safeguards.
