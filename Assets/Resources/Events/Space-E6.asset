  mIntroMessage: <CityName> extended its influence beyond Earth through orbital facilities,
    lunar industry, and early colonies. Advanced reactors and long-range travel opened
    new frontiers, but resources stretched thin and political interests diverged
    across worlds. Each decision carried amplified consequences, shaping whether
    <CityName> thrived among the stars or fractured under interplanetary pressures.
  mActionMessage: A sudden collapse of helium-3 shipments from lunar and gas-giant
    refineries left FTL reactors starving for fuel. Hyperlane disruptions rippled
    across <CityName>, threatening to plunge entire sectors into isolation.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - rerouted all remaining FTL-capable vessels to secure emergency helium-3 from
    fringe mining colonies.
  - activated reserve fusion farms to synthesise limited quantities of emergency
    FTL fuel.
  - negotiated temporary hyperlane-sharing treaties with neighbouring sectors to
    bypass collapsed routes.
  - transitioned critical supply lines onto slower sublight convoys to maintain minimum
    connectivity.
  - issued a system-wide conservation mandate to reduce FTL usage until stability
    returned.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The redirected vessels reached several remote refineries still holding reserve
    stocks. The emergency fuel convoys returned safely, stabilising <CityName>\u2019s
    FTL grid and preventing sector-wide isolation."
  - Space pirates ambushed the rerouted vessels. Several convoys vanished, deepening
    the crisis and leaving <CityName> more isolated than before.
  - The reserve farms produced a modest but vital stream of helium-3, enough to keep
    critical hyperlanes open. Citizens praised the quick thinking that prevented
    total shutdown.
  - The aging fusion farms overloaded and failed, triggering blackouts across energy
    districts. The failed attempt consumed remaining fuel stocks and worsened the
    shortage.
  - Several neighbouring systems agreed to share stable hyperlanes, maintaining intersector
    travel. The diplomatic success bought <CityName> time to rebuild lost supply
    lines.
  - Negotiations collapsed when rival systems demanded heavy concessions. <CityName>
    was denied access, and regional tensions escalated dangerously.
  - The sublight convoys arrived steadily, if slowly, preserving essential trade
    flow. Though inconvenient, they prevented total economic and logistical collapse.
  - The convoys were too slow to meet demand. Supplies arrived late or spoiled, industries
    stalled, and citizens realised the stopgap solution could not sustain <CityName>.
  - The mandate dramatically reduced fuel consumption. Essential routes remained
    powered, and the measured response kept the crisis contained without triggering
    panic.
  - The restrictions crippled commerce, research, and transport. Frustration erupted
    across multiple districts, and black-market FTL jumps surged despite the ban.
