  mIntroMessage: <CityName> enters an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shapes governance, merchants connect distant routes,
    and scholars preserve knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threaten
    stability. Survival depends on how <CityName> navigates obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: "MORAL DILEMMA \u2014 A controversial case of justice, heresy,
    or peasant revolt forces the realm to choose between strict order and mercy.
    The decision will echo through legend."
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOptionMessages:
  - Hold a public trial for the accused before nobles, clergy, and common folk.
  - Show mercy by commuting harsh punishments to lighter sentences.
  - Enforce strict punishment to demonstrate unwavering authority.
  - Consult a council of theologians and jurists to rule on the case.
  - Defer the decision and send the accused on a religious pilgrimage as penance.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The trial proceeds with clear testimony and measured judgment. Even those who
    disagree with the verdict respect the transparency of the process.
  - The trial devolves into a spectacle of outrage. Shouting drowns out reason, and
    the final judgment satisfies no one, deepening division.
  - The act of mercy softens hearts and prevents martyrdom. Stories spread of a just
    and compassionate ruler, bolstering loyalty among the common folk.
  - Nobles interpret leniency as weakness. Some troublemakers feel emboldened, believing
    the crown unwilling to enforce its own laws.
  - A firm response restores short-term order and deters others from following the
    same path. Nobles feel reassured that the law still has teeth.
  - "The severity of the punishment shocks the populace. Whispers of cruelty tarnish
    the crown\u2019s image, and sympathy for the accused grows quietly."
  - "Their combined wisdom produces a carefully reasoned judgment. The blend of spiritual
    and legal authority strengthens public confidence in the realm\u2019s moral compass."
  - The council becomes deadlocked, issuing vague or contradictory guidance. Confusion
    spreads, and both sides feel abandoned by those meant to guide them.
  - The pilgrimage offers a path of redemption rather than simple punishment. Many
    see the choice as wise, balancing justice with spiritual growth.
  - Some interpret the decision as avoidance. If the accused later fails or flees,
    the crown is blamed for indecision and poor judgment.
