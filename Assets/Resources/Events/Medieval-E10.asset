  mIntroMessage: <CityName> entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes,
    and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened
    stability. Survival depended on how <CityName> navigated obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: A strange fever began sweeping through <CityName>, marked by shivering
    fits and darkened veins. Healers argued over treatments, priests offered prayers,
    and citizens feared the sickness might be a curse upon the realm.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - ordered quarantines in afflicted districts and restricted travel.
  - supported apothecaries and herbalists in experimenting with remedies.
  - organised mass prayer processions and offerings for divine mercy.
  - established dedicated infirmaries staffed by trained healers and clergy.
  - suspended certain taxes and tithes to ease the burden on afflicted communities.
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - The quarantines slowed the spread dramatically. Villages remained safe, and citizens
    praised <CityName> for acting decisively to contain the plague.
  - The restrictions trapped families inside failing districts. Supplies ran short,
    tempers frayed, and anger rose as some accused <CityName> of abandoning the sick.
  - A group of herbalists discovered a mixture that eased symptoms and reduced deaths.
    Hope returned, and <CityName> gained renown for its wise slew of healers.
  - Several untested remedies worsened the sickness. Fear and mistrust spread, and
    some citizens blamed <CityName> for allowing dangerous experiments.
  - "The processions united the frightened populace in shared devotion. Many reported
    sudden recoveries afterward, and faith in <CityName>\u2019s spiritual leadership
    grew."
  - Large gatherings accelerated the sickness, spreading it farther than before.
    Priests struggled to defend the decision as panic surged through the city.
  - "The infirmaries offered structure and skilled care, saving countless lives.
    Citizens admired <CityName>\u2019s compassion, and order replaced chaos in afflicted
    districts."
  - "The infirmaries quickly overflowed, becoming centres of contagion. Exhausted
    healers fell ill, and despair deepened as the crisis outpaced <CityName>\u2019s
    efforts."
  - The relief allowed families to buy medicine, food, and warmth. Gratitude spread
    through the realm, and social unrest weakened as hardship eased.
  - "The treasury suffered from the loss of revenue, limiting <CityName>\u2019s ability
    to respond to other issues. Some nobles blamed the council for weakening the
    realm\u2019s stability."
