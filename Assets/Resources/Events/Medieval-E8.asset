  mIntroMessage: <CityName> entered an age of fortified walls, noble factions, and
    powerful traditions. Faith shaped governance, merchants connected distant routes,
    and scholars preserved knowledge. Yet feuds, famine, and shifting loyalties threatened
    stability. Survival depended on how <CityName> navigated obligations, alliances,
    and the constant pressure of conflict within and beyond its borders.
  mActionMessage: A foreign ambassador left <CityName> in anger after a perceived
    insult at court, offended by a local custom. Their king demanded reparation,
    and the fragile peace between the realms trembled in the balance.
  mProcessedActionMessage: 
  mOutcomeType: Negative
  mOptionMessages:
  - sent envoys with apologies and finely crafted gifts to mend relations.
  - held a formal ceremony acknowledging the misunderstanding and honouring the foreign
    custom.
  - dispatched diplomats to clarify the custom and negotiate a fair reparation.
  - increased patrols along the border to deter any foreign influence.
  - "invited the foreign court to send new representatives to observe and better
    understand <CityName>\u2019s customs."
  mProcessedOptionMessages: []
  mOutcomeMessages:
  - "The envoys were welcomed with grace, and the gifts softened the foreign king\u2019s
    anger. Relations warmed again, and peace between the kingdoms was reaffirmed."
  - The foreign court rejected the apology, calling it insufficient. The king felt
    further insulted, and tensions between the realms sharpened noticeably.
  - "The ceremony impressed visiting dignitaries, who praised <CityName>\u2019s respect
    for their traditions. Trust began to mend, and the gesture prevented further
    hostility."
  - The ceremony was viewed as hollow pageantry, and some nobles mocked the gesture.
    Word reached the foreign king, who took it as proof that <CityName> lacked sincerity.
  - The diplomats explained the misunderstanding with tact and patience. A reasonable
    agreement was reached, and both sides left the negotiation with renewed confidence
    in the peace.
  - Talks collapsed when neither side could agree on the reparation. The foreign
    court accused <CityName> of deception, and rumours of impending conflict increased.
  - The fortified patrols reassured citizens without provoking retaliation. The foreign
    realm hesitated to escalate, and <CityName> gained precious time to stabilise
    the situation.
  - The increased patrols were mistaken for a military threat. The foreign king mustered
    troops in response, and the fragile peace teetered on the edge of war.
  - The visiting representatives were charmed by the hospitality of <CityName>. Misunderstandings
    faded, and new bonds of cultural respect blossomed between the realms.
  - "The new representatives interpreted the invitation as an attempt to cover up
    the original insult. Their reports worsened the foreign king\u2019s opinion,
    deepening resentment on both sides."
