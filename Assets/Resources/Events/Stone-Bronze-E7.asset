  mIntroMessage: <CityName> began as a small community surviving through simple tools,
    shared labour, and ancestral guidance. Basic farming, early metalwork, and cautious
    exploration support daily life, but resources remained limited. Every choice
    shaped whether <CityName> could grow into a stable settlement or struggled against
    scarcity, conflict, and the uncertainties of early development.
  mActionMessage: Unstable weather patterns approached <CityName>, raising fears
    of a destructive storm. The people prepared as best as they could, uncertain
    how severely their homes and routines might be affected.

  mOutcomeMessages:
  - Working through wind and rain, families raised sturdy shelters reinforced with
    clay and timber. The structures held firm, saving lives and giving the tribe
    a fragile but vital sense of security.
  - "Despite desperate effort, the shelters collapsed under the storm\u2019s fury.
    Injuries mounted and valuable supplies were lost, deepening fear and exposing
    the tribe\u2019s vulnerability."
  - "The scouts returned with news of a sheltered ridge where the storm\u2019s reach
    weakened. The tribe relocated just in time, weathering the disaster with minimal
    loss and renewed gratitude."
  - The scouts misjudged the land, leading the tribe into an exposed hollow. The
    storm intensified, bringing devastating floods that shattered morale and resources.
  - Chants echoed across the village as flames crackled in ritual pits. The storm
    seemed to ease briefly, giving the tribe precious moments to regroup and restore
    order.
  - The rites failed to bring relief. Some clans blamed the shamans for angering
    the spirits further, and fear quickly turned into mistrust and blame among families.
  - "Every clan worked with fierce determination\u2014some reinforcing shelters,
    others guarding stores or carrying the vulnerable to safety. Cooperation in crisis
    strengthened unity."
  - Task-groups clashed over priorities, creating chaos instead of order. Precious
    time was wasted in arguments, allowing the disaster to inflict deeper damage.
  - The caves withstood the storm, their walls etched with ancient symbols that comforted
    the tribe. Survival became a spiritual triumph, reinforcing belief in ancestral
    protection.
  - The caves flooded unexpectedly, forcing a panicked escape. The tribe suffered
    injuries, and morale plummeted as once-revered shelters were revealed to be perilous.
